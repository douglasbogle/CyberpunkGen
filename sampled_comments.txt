Technically correct but also not. NV has 4 endings as far as who wins the Battle of Hoover Dam, but each of those 4 has dozens of different variables that change the ending you receive

"> We all want this game to be fixed, sadly there are many people who keep trashing it and insulting whoever liked it with the current state.

Where, exactly? I spend a LOT of time in this sub every day and I have never seen anyone attacking someone because they're enjoying the game. I've seen some idiots being annoying about it but never attacking. HOWEVER, I've seen people attacking those who complain about it because they're ""entitled"", ""whiners"", or whatever."
"I'm curious, has anyone actually taken the time to follow around a (non-bugged) NPC and see where they go and what they do?

Playing slowly through the story though, taking my time so haven't gotten very deep just yet.

- Noticed a couple of t-poses

- A few glitchy NPC animations

- Jackie walked through my car to get to the passenger side door

- My biggest concern, I've had 2 hard crashes since I started playing last night. No idea what caused them, but those have been the biggest hitters in terms of bugs."

If you jumped from a roof, dude turns around, instantly slices him dead...nobody would know you were there.

The other two behind the pillar don't know what's going on. All they've heard is two dumb goons and a gunshot JUST rang out...

The dude slid over to the others immediately, they heard a gunshot the other direction not even a split second before and he kills them both within a split second. Like....fuck should the AI do in this context?"

"far cry had an autodrive feature. One that really works out great.lAutodrive and you don't touch the controls is really slow (speed limit?) but you can actually control if you want - speed up, weave through traffic (not that much traffic in FC to be honest, but still), all that doesn't turn off autodrive and when you need to make a turn, the game steers you into it (you can countersteer if you want).  
So you can put on autodrive and go take a leak or something and be at the destination when you return, or you can put on autodrive and not get bored because you actively get to do stuff, in that case it's more of an assistant than an autodrive.  
That would work so nicely in a cyberpunk setting"
Can we stop these posts now. Yes we've all aged 8 years since 2012.  Let's move on already.

At least you can do the other ending without restarting the game

"PS4 Pro: It's a start. I wasn't having **crazy** issues like some apparently were on base console, it's more minor annoyances.

Textures are definitely there now, which is nice. Still doesn't look like a ""next-Gen"" game but it isn't a huge problem to me.

Still having the issue of changing the camera while driving from first person to third. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Menus seem a hell of a lot faster, including reading text messages, quest updates, etc.

Maybe it's placebo, but it seems like there's more NPC activity and the city feels a little more ""alive.""

I think a lot of people need to tamper their expectations, whether CDPR promised it or not, it isn't the game most people were expecting. It's very similar to a Deus Ex, Prey sort of game.

Hopefully they'll continue with these patches and more people will be able to play through it."
"I personally kinda enjoy the buggy mess of a new game. Get to kinda learn stuff and just do the main story. Laugh at all the glitches. Send reports so the game can improve.

Then I can come back in a few months, shits usually better, and I can really dive into side stories and just fucking around."

"Y'know - I like all the songs on Body Heat Radio. I don't like how the same songs are always playing. I swear I only ever hear this song, Holes in the Sun, and maybe two others. And it seems like every building and NPC with a radio is playing Body Heat Radio. Makes it seem like there's 4 songs in the entire time period."
"Really? Because it sounds like you know absolutely nothing about software development. Yeah some devs can fail at time estimations but in the case of CDPR with a team of 200+ devs, there is absolutely no way that the devs are to blame on this one."

"Don't even need grenades. I've managed to complete like the last three missions I've done by running to the checkpoint. The AI doesn't leave their area, and they don't seem to ever chase after me even if they're on alert and know where I am. As long as I can activate some text or something, I can beat the mission and maybe all I had to do is break one door, or hack one terminal. 

I literally drove my bike right up to a door, ran inside past everyone shooting, downstairs to some guy I had to save, and once I came back up all the bad guys were gone."
What happened to that game?
Never again CDPR.

But if the devs actually fix the game than they should definitely make a dlc where you can join Trauma team or Ncpd and if they ever read this the cyberpsycho girl should definitely have part in the MAX-TAC part of the DLC"
I wonder what her name is.

"Go back to bed kid, you're clearly cranky."
"I know that game journalists arent great at games, but I was really surprised to see just how many of the reviewers felt the game was actually forcing you to beat the game quickly, as if there was a hard time limit on finishing the game. Like I even heard Jeff Gerstmann saying he would try replaying the game except see what would happen if he ignored the death warnings. I felt like for any people who play games frequently, would see from a simple game design perspective that the attacks only get ""worse"" during specific scripted triggers, hardly impacts gameplay outside of a 5-10 second animation, and that a game with so much to do surely wouldnt just kill you for trying to be completionist."

Valve - Used to be good and frequently bring out top tier games. Got lazy once steam turned into a cash cow and now might bring out a new game once every ten years.

Rockstar - used to be good and make decent games frequently. Not quite up to Valve levels of idleness yet as they still make one game about every five years but definitely got worse once GTA online became their cash cow."

This game is a story driven RPG disguised as an open world game.

"Keanu's line delivery has little to no emotion other than ""general angst"" behind it. Dont get me wrong, he does that one specific tone well, but other than that its really bad. He has a terrible emotional range and it results in really clumsy voice acting. His pacing is really off as well and it sounds like he just woke up 100% of the time. At first I didnt mind it that much, but the more plot involved johnny got and the more scenarios I had to hear Keanu stumble his way through, the more grating it got. It resulted in a character that is difficult to take seriously"
I would reload the game to avoid doing that to my boi

"Hey man awesome stuff. I have a couple questions:

3.) I *feel* like Dreams would have a feature that's like ""create timelapse video of your project"" or something like that. Does that exist or did you have to create this video manually?

Really nice work, man!"

You should be fine. Might need to crank something here and there down but if the 2060 is good enough for RT minnimum the 2060 super should do decently on high specially with the rest of your PC being well over recommended.
"Unity works fine now and to this day the crowd tech is still probably the best there is. It's order of magnitude better than Cyberpunk.

"Finally someone who seems to share my opinion. To me Witcher was basicly the same game, only differnet setting and in 3rd person. Dialogues and story flowed pretty much the same, quests basicly boiled down to ""go to place, kill enemies, search for shiny object, go back"", just like here. I dunno why everyone keeps shitting on cyberpunk for the exact same things they loved in the witcher."
"Depends on how they handle it (well, the underlying engine). Could be that if everything is packed, you have to download the whole package again, not just the line which is changed. Therefore changing a one letter in a single line could lead to downloading a 5GB file. (Thats just a simplified example)

A good example is the beginning of Star citizen. At some point they changed it, but in the beginning you had to download the whole game again for a new version of the game, even if it was just a patch."

She may fit the ""quirky and interesting part,"" but the rest of her does not fit that classic role. More than capable of killing and making it on her own."
Yes.
"dont give a shit about the old console crap, why is the game missing so many features? Not even just promised features but basic ones? Why is the game chopped up so much?

"Sorry for your loss.  I had a similar experience when MGSV came out it was a game me and my closest friend were excited to play, we did however get to play it until I lost him a week after it came out.  I couldn't touch the game after that for over a year after that.  My recommendation is not to play CP2077 until you find yourself at peace with his loss.  You will know when the time is right to start it up."
lmao i thought that was a glitch. turns out i just forgot i had that implant mod installed. haha i suck at this game
I'd give it a 10/10 too just to convince myself that all that crap wasnt for nothing lol
"Definitely, gta v did most things better.. And that game is ancient. And the graphics weren't much worse. Also the fact that 98% of your choices are meaningless when they promised they would matter bugs me."
"She was actually one of the first people I played DnD with! I’d been wanting to play for a while, so just went up to my roommates and asked; “if I wrote a story, and acted as the DM and controlled the rest of your party (there were only two of them so I had to fill out the cast), would you guys be down to play?” And we spent like a week creating characters for them while I gathered resources to understand what I was actually doing, writing a story and making side characters and whatnot. 

We had a fair bit of fun, and it was cool to see her get into the roleplaying aspect of it while the other roommate was kind of just goofing off. It’s just the two of us now so the potential is there for sure!"
Who the hell downvoted a puff puff pass??!!
"The story was just okay, the choices barely matter, hacking is boring, breach protocol is too easy, some of the dialogue is off, performance was shite at release, experience with bugs varies from a person to a person (I personally could barely move from place to place without dying for no reason), AI is/was non-existent, driving is not that good (and the 1st person camera placement in most cars is too low + minimap is not zoomed out enough), the backstories practically don't matter, romantic relationships aren't important enough. Also, I love Keanu, but his acting is way too monotone to be practically the main character. Oh, and the ""sick"" aspect of the game - it's just a dollar store knock off of RDR2. In RDR2 it felt depressing and gave me a feeling of pressure. In CP77 I just felt annoyed whenever it came up in a fight, whenever it came up in a non-scripted dialog (so no characters acknowledged it, including V, even though she's vomiting blood mid talking, but the talk goes on as if nothing happened)

All of that is just off the top of my head. There are aspects of the game I liked (hence ""I enjoyed Cyberpunk""), but I expected a 2020 AAA game, not late 00s/early 10s. I enjoyed melee fighting and snipers, I enjoyed the graphics, I enjoyed the characters, I enjoyed the world, I enjoyed (most of) the story, I enjoyed (most of) the quests. But that's it. I enjoyed them. They weren't particularly moving, thought provoking, interesting. The game doesn't shine in any particular way, maybe except the world creation (Night City is fucking beautiful and it's insane how many little things and details there are). It's just a mediocre game. It's disappointing due to the promises and wasted potential. Because it feels like an unfinished game. Because if the game came out a year or two later, it could've been a masterpiece.

The crucifixion was my favourite mission."
The street cred is usually worth the wanted level.  Not sure if a bug or feature tho
The devs thought of all the little details.
I know that feeling :(
"I lost my father on 11.06, cardiac arrest. I feel your pain. Please accept my condolences, and stay strong! You need to play the game man, I'm sure your son would want you to have a blast!"
"Honestly get a PC even for future proofing your games. I love FPS games usually on my PC but cyberpunk plays so well on the sofa and TV. I use a steam link box with my PS4 controller and it plays perfectly! I have a pc a few years old with a gtx 1080 graphics card and I can get 60-80fps just couch gaming happily with steam link. I actually debated getting a console again for casual couch gaming but now I don't need to with steam link it works so so well. 

If you can afford to then you really can't beat gaming when it comes to PC's, even if you prefer a controller or couch gaming it's just so versatile to your needs"
Too much hype was put on Cyberpunk. Everyone was eagerly waiting for the game and it kept getting delayed. And every time it got delayed the hype grew ten times. It got to the point where people were expecting the second coming of Jesus Christ. If the game had just come out in April with no delays people wouldn’t be in posts coming up with little things to gripe about to make the game look worse. Like complaining about not being able to play the arcade games in the city or driving being bad on keyboard. Driving is always bad on a keyboard including games like GTA. I’m enjoying the game for what it is. I haven’t experienced any performance issues and barely any bugs. So I’m enjoying the game for what it is. An open world game set in a Cyberpunk dystopian universe.
we leave greed to others
"I think he meant random car chase ambushes from clans that has negative relationship with you.
So far the game only has story related car ambushes."
And yet you will be using that option....
Try driving into Japantown across one of the long bridges. You won't see a single car along the way.
I know I do. Cum take me away (from behind teehee) 🍆🍆🍆👌💦💦💦 uwu
"Damn bro, u have a lot of FPS experience. What games do u usually play?"
"I like how V sleeps, what are you gonna do about it"
Ahh gotcha!
"“Elder millennials, tell us the tale of why we can’t have insulin and debt free college”

“Well you see we abandoned the brave mujahadeen fighters and they were pissed. So they killed 3000 Americans and we decided to retaliate by leveling two unrelated countries and spent all the money for the future on murdering a bunch of middle eastern civilians.”"
"Idk I've had mine since 09 never really had an issue with the twin cams or evo. Back in the day pre evo motors definetly spent more time fixing than riding. Plus they leaked and if it was not leaking your were in trouble. Everyone has their preferences plus they're cheaper to get a hold of.

EDIT: wasn't leaking"
"I feel like Oda was misused, such a cool character and he was barely touched. Much like many other storylines and characters in the game"
YEEEEEEAAAAAÀAAAAHHHHHHHHHH
"True its either white bandana or nothing, especially since it just glitches out and makes V bald every time you look in the mirror with headgear on."
Yeah I agree with you 100%. They really raised the bar way too high.
"Really would have, unfortunately where I live doesnt have anything like that."
"Cyberpunk is an official holiday too me. I took time off from work to celebrate it. 

I don't celebrate Christmas. That has no meaning too me 🤷‍♂️"

"OOF...

The AI isn't very good but at least SA has Traffic AI lol"
That's why you GOOGLE!
Rtj is lit af and I'm so fucking happy that they are making music for the game
"I mean, at first she seemed a little upset that I made her coach/gym owner kill himself while on was on my way out of the gym, but she seemed to be over it by the time I met her at the final fight."
I agree with this. If we really want to talk about games that have dropped the ball look at anthem.
"Fr I looked at the number and assumed it must be in km/h (I normally use yeehaw units), but nope. Apparently I can go 200mph down a normal street and still be in control"
Same for me with the city center. :/
Hoping for AI DLC
Would you prefer her if she was white
"This is how id like them to dig themselves out of this cater  but I some how dont think they have the balls to change the story completely. 

Id love them to fuck Keanu off completely. His character honestly sucked but some how i dont think they will."
"> DLC featuring cut content

every game have cut content. Every game could be release year later and offer DLC as core game."
"To be fair, cops just appearing behind you is a staple of the GTA series and it happens all the time in GTA V even on PC with maxed draw distance and crowd settings."
Crashes for me right at 2 hours which is typical of before the patch. My patience with the crashes is wearing thin especially with 3 patches now claiming to help crashes and not seeing any change.
"Probably memory leak. As the game runs and certain things use RAM, that memory isn't correctly freed up when those things go away."
"No, not even close. They never tied Johnny and Keanu together in game. They never made any reference that Johnny=Keanu which is what you're comparing it to."
Then they shouldn't have cut wall running and wall latching
I have preorder woth samurai medailon
"Maybe it's setting things up for the sequel...

Haha!"
There's 159 main characters and Hundreds of NPC's walking around. No room for multiplayers.
The blue truck pisses itself at the end.
"I've played about 8 hours and finally had to quit because I was just so frustrated and fed up with the game. It's a buggy mess and an RPG my ass. 2077 felt more like a looter shooter skinned GTAV than an rpg. I know Witcher 3 had pretty basic rpg systems but that game did a better job at being an rpg than 2077. 

Also fuck 1st person view. More immersive than 3rd person cutscenes my ass. More like motion sickness simulator 2077."
That guy talk funny asf

"Action is blocked but it puts your fists away. Drop it again and pick it up again with the use button then quick switch weapons. Appears to only work with melee weapons, don't know if it still works now on 1.05 but was working last night on 1.04"
"Facts, man. I mean, I’d be happy to pay the full price if they ripped the game down and actually finished it. I just don’t think that’s gonna happen, though I wish I was more optimistic :/"

You've been making good progress on your cosplay. Keep the updates coming
"Sony is allowing it, mine is downloading now."
"Lol you're havin a fuckin anyeurism over this, relax.

Yes, CDPR lied, went hard on false marketing... these are shitty business practices that they deserve to be punished significantly for...

But the game is still fun in a lot of ways and sufficiently complex. I'm already running a second build to try out different skill trees than my first run.

But also, I think a lot of us that are enjoying it 

(a) are playing on pc

(b) didn't buy into the hype and largely ignored the marketing

(c) played the witcher and are aware of what CDPR are and are not capable of

Once again, I'm not excusing what CDPR did, and yes, you were lied to... but... y'all could have seen this coming. It happens all the time in the gaming world... and its funny you say ""STOP SUCKING CDPR OFF"" when all of you that believed every lie they sold you were sucking fucking hard for the last couple years and now you're just mad that all that sucking didn't pay off."

"I cannot fucking wait for the upcoming patches! I'm playing on PC and after finishing the main story I decided to put the game on hold and wait for more stability and gameplay improvements because I'm not going to lie, the experience was a mess.

A good mess with incredible animation, world, and acting, but still a technical mess."

Thanks! I am watching my clock....
I’m playing this on PS4 Pro. You’re lying. Stop it. Get some help.
NASA should hire you to throw things in the orbit. What the fuck was that?

"Lol same shit happens in red dead, people want you to save their ass. I normally stop and start blastin’ but definitely passed a few up"
Really hyped but my hype is 50% less than it could be because I have to play it on base PS4 until I get a PS5 early summer..
this is horrible! I love it!!
[excluído]
I'm the exact same. I'm on One S and it's running decently. FPS isn't fantastic and the grainy reflections are a bit annoying but other than that it's great! Really enjoying it. We must have just gotten lucky. I also think it crashes a lot less on Xbox than Playstation for some unknown reason
It’s too late Nastya
"Um did you forget that this game has guns as well?  
Also Skyrim's melee system isn't really any different from Cyberpunk's, they're both just light attacks and strong attacks.
 
Melee in this game is much better than Fallout 4 which is what we should be comparing it to."
"Thank you for your reply! It was joyful to read through the many positive responses, and hearing similar experiences. I may not always be able to respond to individual comments, but I will be available in the chat. Thanks again!"
"I would assume, and hope, that February is their time table for fixing launch bugs, and the other stuff you mentioned would be handled by the DLC teams."
"I can't wait to spec into getting a 0.06% more running speed!

Him having finished everything in the game and still only having unlocked a very small part of the perk tree makes you wonder what is even the fucking point in having these RPG elements in this game."
"take these into consideration

reviewers had denuvo drm on their copy, there will be no denuvo drm on our copies

reviewers did not play on day 1 patch

reviewers did not play on the drivers that nvidia are going to roll out on launch"
Immersive if you never played other games before.
"Am I the only one who really likes the younger design for Ev they have here? Doesn't work for where the story took her, of course, wouldn't have passed for a high class prostitute, but still. I just prefer the character of her in the art."
"The first part of the game was fun and all. I got flatlined in the stupid scavver car chase that’s made to make you think this is an interactive world and chilled on a loading screen for three minutes, but when V lies down on the bed like that I realized I was in for a bumpy ride."
That gives me some hope that they did something good with this romance. Thank you!  😄
Awesome! It's Negan time! (Baseball bat)

"I had a moment early on when I stumbled upon a gang fight and intense music started playing.

"I wonder if this will fix my game having the same fps (around 30-40) regardless of which settings I am running on. As long as I am enabling DLSS high performance, I have 30-40 fps on low preset and 30-40 fps on raytracing ultra preset."
Can I change the paint job of guns? I don't want to use the ugly ass paint job of some random gonk I killed on the street
"My super shitty gen 2 i3, 8 gigs of of ram and rx 580 are doing a pretty good job. Much better than I thought after reading all the complaints. Game runs smoothly and beautifully (at 1080) so far. I'm sure ray tracing would be a game changer but nvidia and proprietary graphics tech can eat my ass"
"Driver issue, update/reinstall."
Im so nervous for if this game will run atleast acceptable on a regular ass ps4.. all these people saying 900p at 30fps have me nervous
The like to dislike ratio is actually unbelievable to me right now
"Largely because it exposes that the npcs have no time path like promised.

"As much as I hate bi-erasure, I think they were just lazy"
It's still gonna win a bunch of game of the years tho lol
"The whole Cyberpunk 2077 release has just shown us once again that critics can't be trusted. Critics are often times just as big delusional fanboys as regular gamers and will fall for Hype and pedigree.

Even without the poor performance and bugs this game is nowhere near a 10/10."
This game is like the Truman show
These kids are terrifying
And driving sucks.
That's fine. But how come the NPC at the end gets in the car?
"This, fucking this, why are they just completely ignoring it? Its so shady, it feels like we're being shit all over and we don't matter."
I saved right before Judy's romance scene so I can replay it when I want since there's nothing to do with her afterwards. \*Sigh\* I'm so alone
"YESSS. I’ve been waiting for more videos of this bug. I love to see just how the animations look in third person, because they still look weird in first person. Though I gotta say, the reloading animations are all incredibly well done."

"I can't wait for the realistic walking mechanics, this is what those delays were for!"
"Thank you for that, I really didn’t want to sound like a gatekeeping pedant."
you surely mean 2 seconds?
Damn we are so simple but so good
"They expected everybody to freak out then go into other phases of outrage/grief they can exploit to make us all wait for them to fix the game post-launch. They know we will because most big releases nowadays include this process. The more honest devs are starting to just say fuck it and make their games Early Access (if they can) and everybody has learned the exact wrong lessons from No Man's Sky.

No, they knew people would notice. They rolled them Mass Effect: Andromeda dice. But people were already getting sick of Bioware tripping over themselves and CDPR was the golden child of gaming until exactly 5 days ago. They might crash harder or skate easier based on that."
"There are some great sidequests in here that are Deus Ex tier. BUT unfortunately the game absolutely overloads the player with tons of sidequests and blows up your phone anytime you are near a side activity that it becomes difficult to tell which side quests are carefully tailored quests and which ones aren’t. 

The thing that hurts side quest visibility the most is the fact that a lot of them only give exposition through the cell phone if you are near the quest. You don’t go to the fixer or meet a middleman for most of the side quests for them to explain why you should care. V is a merc and the game constantly treats V as a character who only cares about eddies, so they rarely give a reason to care except for more money! In Deus Ex, you meet NPCs who explain how they are in a fucked up situation and need help and there’s lots of conversation options with them. Sometimes Cyberpunk gets it right like with the monk's brother sidequest. That is one of the few quests where I wanted to do it because I felt bad for the monk and wanted to make the Maelstrom gangsters pay for being assholes. It also makes V a more sympathetic character than just a greedy merc. But they bury so much good content under shallow fluff activity that populates the map. 

The pace of quest rollout is ridiculous, especially at the beginning of act 2. There is no reason my quest journal should have SEVEN separate Delemaine entries cluttering up my log when they are all part of ONE questline."
"Edwardos are the new Geraldo, no?"
"only on old hardware that it really wasn't designed for [it was designed to be played on high end PCs with consoles getting a scaled down version whereas most games are designed on console with higher end systems getting scaled *up* versions] it runs pretty well on a high end PC with very few bugs, put 80hrs in and only encountered a handful of major bugs [broken quest, the game suffered a stronk a few times and i had to restart, and collision bugs where I got launched into space] play it on hardware that can run it before you judge it too harshly"
but how cheap is it?
I was wondering if she would still bang you if you were feminine in voice and body and had a penis. Got my answer lol
Yeah but it doesnt have a picture in the entries.
"Don't sweat the haters man, you look badass! I need to get myself a Samurai shirt."
"Exactly. Most games don't have a ""no motion-sickness"" button. You just increase FOV, disable motion blur, and turn off bobbing. These options don't require additional features. It's just adding a switch instead of a forced on.

"Hello yes, I'd like to play as the most compassion lacking and corrupt person possible. What do you mean i cant shoot civilians?"
"After my second play through I feel Johnny is just as dumb (if not dumber) as V, so taking his advice and opinion is kinda like the Dumb leading the blind. 

But I’m going for that secret ending this time around so streetkid V does whatever Johnny says"
"Well he's not dead because Short Circuit is non-lethal. 

Now I'm a bit curious if *actually* killing him with lethal damage affects the outcome at all. Probably not, though."
This. Dang it. My eyes are burning.
Also it feels wierd if you call Jackies mom right before and are picking up your car to go to his funeral.
"100%, i think the camera height could be a little higher too, help setting where your going a little"
"And do I take you by the hand.

And lead you through the land.

And help me understand the best I can?"
"Oh my god I just watched Fall of 76.

I had no idea how bad it went!

That email from Bethesda about the bag....wooooooow."
Every time a big release like these there will be people that downplay the problem because they don't have any. I remember TotalBiscuit talking about this issue like a few years ago when he's still alive and healthy. It's a phase.
"Hey kid, psst. Have you tried alt+f4 

;)"
"Adding to this, I’ve been getting very inconsistent subtitles as well"
"Right now I'm playing Horizon primarily and Ghost of Tsushima on the side. 

Both fun games but yeah,  can't stop thinking of CP2077"
"Seeing as Bioware has failed many times to even replicate what made Origins good, I doubt we ever will, at least in the AAA scene."
"Oh i love the game too, the mods need to get a handle on this sub though."
Forgot the shoes and posters.
"I have heard they have been pressured to accept stuff that never should have been accepted just to V fixing bugs that never really got fixed.
Its the mangment's fault."
"Wait...for me, I called and V got his voicemail and was like... ""I don't know where you are..you wouldn't believe what happened to me""...

And then later it said the line was disconnected"
Send it to borat pages? Can't hurt to try.
This is for digital pre-orders. If you bought a hard copy you’ll have to wait for it to be delivered.
Nope I will never trust CDPR with a preorder ever again.
"I totally agree. I've jsut finished it, and im sad. So little left to make this game great (beside time). Just get rid of bugs, polish some systems and ai, becuase story wise its great experience even in this shape. I will go back after nextgen patch to make another run."
"So glad he didn't only mention the bugs/performance but also all the missing gameplay features and false advertising.

CD Projekt still doesn't seem to acknowledge the problems this game really has. 

""Sorry for old-gen consoles, but PC is fine, bye"""
"I chose to not have any piercings, tattoos, or other body mods when I made my character so that I would get more intense as the game went on/street cred increased/whatever. 

Oops :("
"I think you're right that the foundation for a really great game is here. It's going to take a lot of work to get there though. What's upsetting for me now is the lack of transparency from CDPR so far. What happens next is really critical in terms of my optimism for the game - If they come out, acknowledge the problems with full transparency and provide some kind of even very rough, conservative roadmap for their plans to fix the game, I'll be satisfied. If the company goes into denial or refuses to divulge any plans, I won't have a whole lot of faith."
what about the e3 2018 trailer?
"Is there a good Risitas meme about Cyberpunk? You know, the Mexican laughing guy. I think that would be perfect. This is good too though"
Same. Refunded the game and enjoying my time with this ever growing mess
my aim is gonna be fucked for multiplayer games haha
"I have a ps5. Turn off the visual settings like motion blur, aberration, etc. and that weird blur is gone.

But go ahead and wait if you’re still not feeling it."
"Same! Planning to finish this 100% too. Literally only other games I did that was for Miles Morales and God of War because they are amazing too!

Definitely gonna do another playthrough when DLC 1 comes out, should have enough money saved up for a 3080 by then as well so, cant wait!"
"Except that CP77 isn't a shooter. It's an RPG with shooter mechanics.  


EDIT: And if you compare it with games in that genre (like Mass Effect, Destiny, Division etc.), a kill time of 1-3 seconds is super fast."
Pain editors is how I wrap my head around a woman in a tank top and underwear tanking my gorilla arms with internal bleed mod and beating my ass.
Explaining that to dudes with no experience with women will be tough. They think every girl should just like them because “why not?”
In short not anytime soon. Time to uninstall the base game.
"> Yes, this kind of interaction *can* happen, but a well programmer piece of software should try to minimize that 

But this is not a well programmed piece of software. This is a pile of spaghetti code the size of a mountain. Its a testament to the devs that it runs at all, given how it was released two years before they wanted it to be. I can well imagine there is nothing trivial about any of these fixes, as underwhelming as they may end up seeming to us users."
"I never got nms becuse at the time I had my eye on star citizen (yeah I know), but I was so glad that I didn't buy into the hype before it came out. The game was a complete dumpster fire and was far from what was promised. But on the other there is a really good video by Internet historian on youtube, that explains exactly what the hell happened to those promises and why they were made. And now the game is just fantastic and amazing. It took them long to get there but they did. I find that my articulation does not do justice to explain the entire situation that was the pre release but I suggest you watch the video. It really opened my eyes to how the release and development was mismanaged."
YESSSS I really thought I was imagining things. I have a 2060 super and ryzen 5 3600x and sometimes I’ll have 60fps with ray tracing then next time I start game I suddenly having less than 30
he actually has a 10 eddie bounty on him
"I'm playing it on the One S, too, and it looks awful -- but not in a 'oh this is clearly a downgrade for current gen and that's fine'..it clearly looks unfinished and rushed, like it \*could've\* been better even with last gen technology. That being said, I'm having fun with it, but it's a huge disappointment from what it could've been."
"Can you tell me what's wrong with the gameplay itself? Disregard the crashes or bugs, the AI system being faulty, or the lack of being able to get a haircut, (that last being just a meme at this point), what do you find is an issue with the gameplay itself?"
"tbh it was not really that bad, you just have to make sure you do several blue baton/skull icon after each of the several hours in-game. Atm I am equipped with 2 legendary items, 2 epic and 1 rare, by just doing any blue icon missions."
"The great thing is the ""rushing"" is not artificial. 

It all comes from the great story and the game itself. Each camp being shittier and shittier, people dying left and right....

The game has an awesome sense of urgency and as player you can't justify grabbing legendary coyote pelt anymore lol.

"You've moved on to spending your time on the Cyberpunk subreddit instead, then, eh?"
"I hadn't really encountered anything too funny after about the same amount of time, then that all changed today. I found a spot where cops had pulled over a tower of seven cars, then later I found a roadblock that cars would smash through, then explode a little farther down the road."
Quick send the teleportation police!
"High presets at 1080p 50-60 fps assuming your CPU is at recommended, I think the recommended 1060 can hit only hit 30 fps but I really hope I'm wrong. The OneX i believe has the gpu equivalent to the gtx 970 so it'll be running minimum which is low with npc density set as low as possible (as seen in the console gameplay thats everyone's bitching about), Current gen CPU's are too weak."
To be fair they do seem to have reverse engineered the NPC AI from Deus Ex: Human Revolution on the 360 so you sort of got what you wanted.
"This confused me.

You know when in demos you used to get to the end and it would give you a highlight reel of ""things you'll get when you buy the game""? That's what it felt like.           
I basically got the ""previously on cyberpunk 2077"" episode catch-up.           
I get it is supposed to be a montage to show time progression and all...but that's not a great tool in such an interactive medium."
"ding-ding-ding.

This is Executive vs. Product Management vs. Development 101. At some point all three loosely agreed on something a long time ago. Then over the lifecycle messages got lost in translation in all directions, scope creep (in this case, we got barely an MVP), and time crunch after time crunch.

Could devs have done better - sure, they're not perfect. However this delivery (obviously) stinks of business first, quality second."
"Doesn’t really explain going in by yourself where you go from cyberspace to your house. My guess is you just don’t see what happens right after V and Johnny’s decision. Probably just skips a few weeks right after to the Epilogue. If anything my guess is V/Johnny were put back in the body, woke up at the access point and was able to escape fairly easy seeing as Alt fried everyone on the Arasaka network."
"I haven’t heard this song in years, yet I immediately recognized it without audio as well. Haha."
"Ong, love ya hermano"
Exactly. They get to play 12 hours earlier than PC folks.

"I can't determine anymore if it's a bug, feature or console commands."
im just joking man i appreciate your being a good dad
"I don't know why everyone is trying to lie to themselves about the bugs and so harsh on reviews that had major issues with em.. Bugs can be fixed its not the worse thing, rather wait a bit than play a mess and pretend everything is fine."
"No, but we're on a Cyberpunk forum..."
"Weird, since all the dialogue about keeping the datashard said that V could keep the money on the card if he chose not to pay with it. Maybe I’ll find out how on a later date, or maybe not."
I actually thought this was real gameplay b4 I read the title well done
I always wondered why I can't replace my body parts with the pieces I see on the walls everywhere at ripper docs
GT Sport. Still is
"I didn’t take her route so I didn’t get to sleep with her. But my boyfriend did, he had to make suggestive texts for the invite to the motel. So I’m confused as to how this is a surprise unless there is another way?"
you need like $3000 pc to run the game properly at the moment but it works for me
People use fast travel in this game?
They help everywhere!
finish the game before dlc
"NVIDIA windforce 970

I forget my chipset (it's an i5) but it's at least 3-4 years old

I dont need ultra high but I'd like to play it without it being a shit show"
Looks like they designed this game purely to make money off the multiplayer version they are releasing later.
What happens when you put a bag of holding onto a portable hole.
"That's 8-13% of a 60fps, if that's denuvo alone then drivers and a day one patch are hopefully impactful enough to give a significant boost"
"I really miss that ""jaina"" or something like that in 2018 demo :("
It's like they're trying to convince *themselves* they didn't waste $60 by attacking *you* for thinking *you* did.

No worries. Maybe I'm missing something but oh well
Now there’s a classic.
ye
Is this on PC or next gen console? Just got my series x ordered today and can’t wait for better graphics.
"During my Witcher 1, 2 and 3 play through leading up to CP2077 I never once save quit to get a different option unless it was to collect a gwent card. My Geralt was a very grief stricken Witcher at the end of it all. I got all of the ""bad"" endings and I'm fine with it. If anything it makes me want to do a second play through even more. I'm excited to play CP three times as the game grows and changes."
"That’s the thing that bugs me with most modern games, the UI always seems to be designed assuming you’ll be sitting at most 12 inches away from the screen."
"Disco Elysium's entire budget goes to writing though.

It's basically a visual novel."
Don’t feel disappointed you can’t play right now because playing right now is a major disappointment
"Yep, it was already a genre, and already had the name. The name itself is from a short story by Bruce Bethke published in the early 80s, and there were books and movies like William Gibson's *Neuromancer,* Philip K. Dick's *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep* and its movie adaptation *Blade Runner* etc. that defined the genre. 

The genre kind of burned itself out by 1995 as far as many of the original authors are concerned, with Bethke himself even writing a story parodying its cliches. But it's stuck around, since many of its themes are still, and even more relevant today.

Cyberpunk the tabletop RPG borrowed heavily from other works of the genre, especially Neuromancer, and so does Cyberpunk 2077. I'm pretty sure even Panam's tank mission references a short story. I can't remember the author, but there's a short story centered around a protagonist who uses a cybernetic tank to smuggle goods in splintered and war torn post-US America. They even make a point of pointing out it's a cargo model in the game, and describe its controls the same way the story does."
I didn’t expect you to agree but that’s special.
And a better back
"This sounds incredible when you compare it to CP2077. I knew Skyrim characters had routines, but I didn’t know how much AI was put in place. Did this responsibility system exist in Skyrim too?"
"I’ve experienced something different. Maybe it’s because I have focused body, but I’ve bullied those quests. Until Rhino, I was able to just lead in with a hard attack, they would fall, and I ground and pound. Rhino actually blocked things, but I just went full Tank Abbott with the heymakers. If you pop berserk before hand(idk if you have it), you’ve got a nice stretch of time. Added on that, if you have it where time slows at the beginning of combat and when dodging/attacking, you can usually get 3 strong attacks in before the first time stop, dodge back, run and slide to the uppercut for more time slowing. Again, unsure of your levels in your skills, but a hard critical attack breaks 12k and normal flurry is 8k a shot. I guess the main question is: what is your skill tree?"
Yes DO NOT get in the way of NPCs while they drive. I rode with River and watched in horror as he drove over a person that probably wouldn't have been in the road if he hadn't just rammed a car up onto the sidewalk.
"He had some Juggernaut vibes. ""I'm gonna rip you in half now"""
But why are the brakes in cyberpunk suddenly so powerful when you jump out of a moving car?
"Yeah. I did a dedicated pistol build (which has pretty much the exact same 3% perk)  and had plenty of points to throw around high 30s/low 40s. That’s when I picked it up there. Had plenty of wiggle room despite it being one of the last handgun perks I got and nearly maxing the cold blood tree beforehand. The build still ended up with room for a good few extra perk points that I threw into health regen, breach protocol, and stealth."
It won't be popular for much long if the future updates are like the last two. The casino update was the last good update.
Nice :D Really nice :D
"was gonna mention this, solves the problem op is having competely.

"I cannot even believe they're somewhat blaming old gen consoles as part of the reason when quite frankly they just created a shit game, it has nothing to do with the consoles themselves and everything to do with how they optimized their game.

Even certain aspects of your game were flawed that other games got right 10+ years ago on even older gen consoles, things like physics, combat, driving..

Can I remind you that these games can be played on a Day 1 PS4 and run beautifully:

- Ghost of Tsushima

- God of War

- Red Dead Redemption 2

- Detroit: Become Human"
"I like how you were probably just looking at the ass on the NPC, but just happened to catch this gem as a random chance"
Did nothing for me and I checked to make sure the changes were still there. Game isn't overwriting it. You can delete the file and the game won't even care.
"OK. I dunno where people keep thinking this game was developed for 7+ years, but this false information needs to stop. Yes they got the rights to Cyberpunk 7+ years ago, and announced they would be making a game, but development didn't begin until after development of the Wither 3 (and it's major dlc) was completed. That means the game was in development for 4 years tops. The writing team likely started story planning before that, but actual game development has only been going on for 4 years."

"This is fckn legit. I've neve really got the damn rules for this mini puzzle and even when I try to understand clearly I missed something so. 

#***shut up and take my upvote***"
sounds like slow death.
"What about branching storyline? Nothing in this entire game was made to have an rpg like dialogue options in the first place imo. Im still asking myself what wouldve happened if I joined with evelyn parker and not with dex in the beginning of the game? And would there be a option to save jackie? 

Not to mention that the story is super short and i didnt even once had a life or death situation option to choose who to side with. Nothing in this story takes place like mass effect. Anyone else remember the hard thought of thinking about killing the geth or quarians and who we side with?"
"Sorry, I should’ve looked more into oblivion before making random statements. I guess you’re right, by the time Skyrim released Bethesda was more popular and as a result Skyrim is their most popular game, not necessarily their most accessible game. Thanks for the information and thoughtful discussion!"

"Nah, V has a phone. They use it in a cutscene like, once."
"Wow, they turned off comments on it."

You guys are so fucking weird when it comes to other people’s positive experiences with this game
Will I get to ____ judy x100
Probably DLC soon. Cyberpunk 2077 - Sacks and circuits. (Tm)
I can't go on! Ok I feel great again!
"I mean if you have confirmation you can get a refund that's different. But the expectation from gamers in general that you can put 50+ hours into a game and then demand a refund is kinda absurd. 

I personally love the game. Granted, I'm playing on xbox series x post hotfixes and have only noticed a slight decrease in performance once with minor glitches. I've followed the release of this game from the beginning and am a little dissapointed they didn't flesh out the open world. Also, while the story is good I'm not a fan of the ""you have 2 weeks to live but go explore and do side missions!"" Plot. Other than that, gunplay is satisfying, the AI, while not good, is passable, the world looks beautiful, the characters are intriguing, all in all I'm satisfied.

If I could offer a word of caution, 1.2 will most likely NOT add in new content, I can almost assure you. Maybe some tweaks to AI, bugfixes, etc. But if you're looking for the game to add in missing features, I think you're going to be disappointed."
A dildo-based healthcare system is the backbone to any good modern society.
"In the end, no review should say to you what you should or not play. I can always see the criticism or the good news about anything but I believe the only one guy who can tell you If you will like the game or not is you ... Everyone is different from one another and the level of what they want and how they want x what they get is really personal. My advice on this is always check for yourself, in CP2077 side, the devs just released a great return policy and If it is a game you don't like you can even get a refund."
""" In my opinion the word detail, story beats and feeling of exploration in cyberpunk shit all over GTA and Skyrim. ""  


I'd say the writing is about on-par with GTA, albeit less comedic and darker in nature. World detail? Not even close to on-par. The city is filled with permanently locked doors, there's not that much interaction with infrastructure/businesses compared to GTA and as for exploration, GTA rewards the player for exploring with a TON of random unmarked encounters and easter eggs. Cyberpunk ""exploration"" amounts to ""drive down this 3 mile long road to a large yellow exclamation point to see what the deal is."" It's not \*bad\*, per-se, it's just kinda...spoonfed? Predictable?   


"" Skyrim felt the same every time you started, the radiant quests were terribly hollow and compared to Cuberpunks map, flat as a pancake. ""  


I have to just disagree completely here, I'm afraid. Character class and even race have a HUGE impact on how you are treated in Skyrim, right down to close to the start of the game. Meanwhile, Cyberpunk 2077 absolutely gutted the character backstory mechanic, with background specific dialogue having essentially no noticeable impact on the actual story.   


Cyberpunk edges out Skyrim for verticality, but Skyrim has...actual mountains, hardly flat as a pancake. And yes, even taken none-literally, said mountains are chock full of mines and dungeons to explore. Also, many internal dungeons are multi-levelled.   


Radiant quests are pretty much just filler, \*just like the reported crimes and assaults feature in cyberpunk.\*  


""  I haven’t ever had a CTD, the stutter I experience when loading into a big area is noticeable occasionally but not game destroying like Fallout 4’s disgusting stutter and unstable frame rates, or Skyrim’s instability! ""  


This is kind of like saying that global warming isn't an issue because it's snowing where you are. It's been an absolute nightmare getting the game running well for plenty of players. Ray Tracing is horribly implemented and patches are introducing as many bugs as they fix.  


"" The game runs great on my shitty Alienware gaming laptop with thermal issues and a 1070, I don’t know why some people are having such a shit time, guess I’m lucky. ""  


Conversely, my i5, 16gb of ddr and a factory overclocked, well cooled gtx 1080 gets huge slowdown during driving in the inner city. The fact that our relative setups seem to have no bearing on performance actually indicates that \*the game is not very well coded.\*  


I like cyberpunk 2077, on the whole. It seems to have a soul, of sorts, and it's definitely beautiful, at times. But I also feel like it's having WAY too many excuses made for it. This is not the kind of quality players should expect from a AAA title that was so heavily supported that the Polish government threw millions at it."
"I haven’t played this game yet, but I have been hearing a lot of “there’s nothing to do except for quests”, like that’s a bad thing. Sure, I guess it would be nice for the people into that type of thing to have playable arcade games and whatnot like Rockstar games have, but there are individual side quests in TW3 that are better than all of the little interactions in all of the Rockstar games combined. Quests give you agency and develop the story, and are just way more interesting than the little shitty things you can do.

I’m personally really looking forward to playing this game once I finally get myself a 3080."
"I tried not to read any guides or spoilers, and was SURE that River was gay based on his flirty interactions with my male V. Tried to get it on and immediately shot down :("
quest itself was great. If you choose to ignore it however it significantly becomes annoying. A quest never should be this invasive.
"The only game I ever played with non-linear storyline and choices, was Detroit: Become Human. And if I remember right, CDPR promised the same experience in this game. Sooo looks like it was an another lie."

Peek immersion!
To be fair. They haven’t made an open world game with any modern technology before.
"""these are mine now"""
ughhh I wish I could play new game plus so bad
Eh don’t believe everything you see here. It’s quite fun. Not worth $60 tho but I don’t get a ton of bugs
The games poor quality leads back to Keanu Reeves
"Yep, there’s also a legendary one that drops in a cyberpsycho mission, but of course it only ever drops with chemical damage and has a chemical effect on it. Strangely any that I find, other than the one specifically for that cyberpsycho misson, only drop in the common rarity. It will be lying on the ground displaying as an Epic, Rare, or uncommon, but as soon as I pick it up it reverts to common."
"On the PlayStation website there is a banner with link for Cyberpunk refunds, which directs you to another link that says ""click here to submit a refund request"". I clicked the link but there didn't seem to be any response. I haven't received a confirmation email yet. Do I just wait?"
Lmaoo I guess the perks of having worked at Victoria’s Secret
Lmao never tried at 4 stars. I did leave at 2 stars no problem tho.
I hope nobody believes this bs. Clearly just to save time /resources so they could focus on the insane bugs that they must have had to delay.
I've never played. Picked it up on sale and haven't started. Maybe I should give it a shot. Am I able to play for an hour at a time and still have fun?
If I had my free award rn it would be yours
It's rough on computers unless you have a i9-9900k and a 3090...or are fine with playing at 720P high settings.
That little smile on your guys face tells you everything
YUP.  This comment and others like you are the reason why game companies get away with shit like this.  NOTHING TO SEE HERE.
Yepo\~ Literally just an amazing story too
"How old are you that you can't read a handful of paragraphs?




Also, dissecting character personalities and motivations is pretty common. There's a reason books like *Frankenstein* and *Lord of the Flies* are considered universal classics, despite being ""just a bunch of ink on paper"".


 Have you, by chance, graduated from high school yet? I'm surprised you've never done a proper analysis of any form of literature. That was stuff I did in elementary, and my school wasn't exactly prestigious. If you have, then that means you didn't retain much. Which is a shame, because public education is designed to be the basic foundation --- the lowest common denominator --- for all adults."
DLC is literally the last thing this game needs right now.
"I had zero expectations and still got let down. Even made a post after te last delay. Holy shit, I just finished it and this thing is a generous 6/10. My fucking heart."
I am so glad most of the posts are chirping the game. It's why I'm here.
"Sometimes I wonder how they could develope such good RPG like W3 but completely fail on every RPG aspect of cp77. It's just insane. Too many of the team that made Witcher left the studio and the management got more and more greedy.

Man, fuck cdpr."
Yeah..id say the initial creator is okay. But the majority of in game customization will be for cybernetics and clothing and hair.
😂😂😂😂😂
">  Cyberpunk is a heartbreak really. U can clearly see that the devs wanted to give the most ambitious open world. I am pretty sure there is an alternate universe where the upper management decided to release the game in 2022.

Welcome to Heartbreak-City!!!

In heartbreak city, depression, loneliness, self hatred, anxiety and pain are everything!"
it'll probably run as well as perfect dark on n64

"They should follow naught dog in there accessibility settings. In the last of us 2 they set the gold standard.

Glad this issue is being addressed and they are working on a solution."
Amazing work!!
if the games ass im gonna take a nice hit of coke to offset the rage
I have too.. I’ve requested many times
Probably none of this stuff is getting fixed :(
very nice
"Yeah like the concepts and overall scale is great! But the problem is, it's not the greatest game ever because of how utterly unfinished it is."
I usually go with regular with vinegar and ketchup. But i will just for you lmao
"Most games I can't really get my body type, face, and hair right"
Bethesda literally had a beta too
"> just read it and it reads like it was written by a child too.

That's kind of how hackers like to talk. I mean yea they are often skilled teenagers, but that style of 1337 pwnd speak goes back to the 90s."
"Yeah that was some big bullshit. And they had the audacity to ask me who did I side with when emulating the Witcher 2 save. Like it mattered.

I should have seen this shit coming. But I was too blinded by how much I liked Witcher 3.

Live and learn I guess."
We'll be lucky if CDPR can even make anything else to sell us...
"Honestly, say what you want. But after 7 years of waiting. My friends who ran through the game are now sitting, whining about how good it was and that it ended whilst I have 100+ hours in the game but I’m enjoying every inch of night city, exploring and doing side quests so I’m nowhere near the end of the game and I’m fckn glad I’m not. It’s like I’m stretching the joy and I think CP is meant to be played that way"
The Beast in Me
"i mostly agree with your list. but i think honestly a faction system would be to much. that it works properly you would need to get very deep in the code imho
real estate would be nice to have but personally i actually want vehicle customization before. the other things i fully agree with"
"Yeah, I got to the point of no return only 30 hours in, for some reason I didn’t realize this was the end of the game. I ended up going back and spending another 50 hrs clearing the map and doing all missions and endings but I was pretty disappointed. I really wish they did a better job showing you the important panam/ rogue side missions before getting to the end. I had no idea what was important or just a random side mission so my play through was kinda ruined playing one of the endings so early. Still loved the game"
Nicee
"Yes, amazing. And it’s aged well too."
Aaaah my neck
This last cutscene made me wish there would be A LOT more cutscenes like this..it was so nice to see your character!
"They might try and claim that, but that's not what the law says, and given previous court cases, I think Sony may find themselves in murky water with the current press coverage."

">Release one game which is not super polished and does not deliver all what was promised and the angry gamers lose their mind and forget the awesome games the company made before Cyberpunk.

I don't agree with the hack, but you're doing some massive downplaying there, even just in Cyberpunk's case. Historically even more so as none of ther releases ever was ""super polished"".

Their releases have always been buggy messes, it's just that Cyberpunk's is also pepper with glamorous levesl of lying to and misleading consumers."
"CD Projekt Red wanted the preorders. 

Now I know to ask what platform when I see gameplay trailers."
"I may be mistaken because it’s been a while since i’ve seen it, but I guess that could be referring to the fact that V is doing an almost suicide mission, and it’s not 100% sure blue eyes can fix you (but I might be wrong do)"
Eh.. Boring. But effective I guess.
I honestly never thought I’d be disappointed by this game. It’s such a let down.
but dat booty. Silverhand wishes he had curves like that. ungh.
Well hopefully they learn to not dick Around for a while. First anthem had that problem and now cyberpunk has that problem. I feel like these company never learn.
"I think this is really the most disappointing thing about this game to me. No interconnection between plot lines, everything is just so dang linear and stays in its own lane, with very little by way of branching, and what branches there are lead to largely the same endpoint and has no practical effect on anything outside its little section.

It'd have been great if there was a path that let you save Evelyn, but cost you a path towards survival or your relationship with Panam. Or choose Panam and lose Evelyn, etc, etc."
Why pay testers when you can have paying fans beta test for you?
"I player Witcher 3 solely because all the quest were unique. No meaningless fetch quest or bethesda radiant quest. Everything hand designed, every story has a small arc. It felt like old Troika games RPG, Fallout 1 & 2 or Gothica. This game just makes me sad. Wasted potential for a good story."
"Not just this game. For Witcher 3 they promised an extensive modkit (called RedKit for CDPR games), but after release they decided that modders are not worth it... eventually they released a lousy scripting tool.

Whoever hopes for officially supported Cyberpunk modding is lying to themselves."
"Aight bois, this game might be one of the worst games of the year."
"I wish the game had a mode that was actually hard, I didn't get to see any of the moves of this guy since I just slowed down time and knifed him to dead with some OP melee build on very hard."
"I'm genuinely confident that in a few years time, cyberpunk will be regarded as one of the best rpgs of all time, MAYBE better than New Vegas"
"I've checked the stores in the wealthier areas and V's default corpo shoes have a higher armour stat than some of the combat boots they offer, 20% of the way into the main story. I can't see much reason to upgrade from my intial gear except for looks."
It's almost certainly replacing a lot of files. The preload (which seems to include the patch) is also apparently around 60GB.
Just had this same issue when Saul inducted me into the Aldelcaldos. Sure gave the family a show
Dude do u heard about screenshots?
They did release mod tools for Witcher 3. Never messed with them myself though. How were they limited?
"They knew that players would focus on it, so they made sure it was awesome. The only thing I disliked was that a car will explode after 10 seconds of being upside down. As soon as you flip, you have to crawl out and run for it because your car turns into a live grenade for really no reason."
I feel like cdpr is making cyberpunk to get Crowbcat back on
"I was sad when I found out that >!V can’t be saved anyway, at least when I went with Panam or Rogue. I messed up my ending the first time by going with Rogue, and then went with Panam and got the ending I wanted. V lives happily ever after with Judy, except that she’s gonna die in 6 months and there’s not shit you can do about it. I thought the story was phenomenal, but going through all the trouble of getting to Mikoshi only to find out that you can’t be saved is mad depressing.!<"
"Agreed. I personally find GTA *less fun* than Cyberpunk, even if it's more technically accomplished. I put off the new heist for a whole month plus, and at least 80% of the time I was playing it I kept having this nagging feeling that I could be playing Cyberpunk instead of this game that seems deliberately designed to annoy me at every turn. Stealth mechanics are inconsistent crap even worse than Cyberpunk, NPCs have perfect accuracy even through dense foliage, and they *still* haven't patched the refire bug that allows NPCs to fire as fast as the engine tickrate, [instantly deleting you with a pistol at effectively random.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OoIZTlg9wdQ) Oh, and these so called ""intelligent"" NPCs will [intentionally make wildly illegal moves just to try and hit you when you're driving](https://np.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/iqu0zz/npcs_dont_purposefully_crash_into_you_is_the/), like cutting across 3 lanes of traffic at a stoplight after the lines change to solid in a physics-defying turn, driving near-perpendicular to the road. Especially if they're ""panicking.""

Also, GTA's cops are cheating bastards. The game intentionally spawns them about ~200m in front of you, and they know where you are at all times and will constantly home in on you, even if the game says they don't. The only really feasible way to lose a high wanted level in a reasonable amount of time is to go somewhere they can't spawn or their pathfinding doesn't permit them to reach like the sewer tunnels. Helicopters respawn faster than you can shoot them down. There's a reason one of the first mods was a police rebalance.

Also, all animals are spawned with cellphones and can report crimes.

----------

If anybody's never played GTA V and doesn't know what I'm talking about with the stealth mechanics:

* Are you allowed to kill them, or do they alert instantly if someone dies?  
* Do you have to knock them out, or is suppressed gunfire allowed?  
* Are you allowed to shoot out cameras or will doing so trigger an alert?  
* Will an alert instantly be triggered if you don't get a 1hko, or do you have a chance to hose them down?  
* Will an alert instantly be triggered if you kill one guard who can see another, or are you allowed to drop both of them in quick succession?  
* Do guards alert on footsteps or not?  
* Do guards alert on nearby bullet impacts or not?  
* Can you pass through the enemy viewcone with a grace period, or does contacting it instantly alert them?  
* Do the enemies have spatial awareness of you being immediately behind them or is it just the viewcone?  
* Does the stealth section even *have* a valid stealth solution or not because the random generation put the target infront of a guard who doesn't move with no-kill rules active?  

NONE of these rules are consistent from mission to mission, and the only way to find out what ruleset you're playing with is to try something, get it wrong, get burned for it, and try again next time. *Very* occasionally the game has the courtesy to tell you about how *one* of the rules is set for the mission you're about to play, like shooting cameras. At least cyberpunk has consistent rules, even if they occasionally fail to work at a mechanical level. Stealth in GTA is like playing chess with a pigeon."
The thing that irks me the most is why the hell is the route for the race mission not on the map
"I noticed that in one of the first missions for street kid option at the beginning. You’re riding in a car, and the side windows show water splashes but looking through the front windshield there was no rain at all."
"Not sure, but I do like to use it to behead downed goons."
"To be fair, probably so are you"
"Had this guy I could talk to after shocking them. They didn't really respond, even of I got new dialogue options."
😢😢😢😢 I'm so sad
Assassin's creed odyssey
"It was, the second team that was working on CP2077 was moved on to work on Witcher 3 so real development started after release of Blood and wine expansion"
That’s all kids are anyway.
"It just gets worse and worse. I hate that he’s basically the main character. It makes me regret trying to carve out a role for V in the first twenty hours, because I realise there is actually no character flexibility involved."
"You don't have to imagine, just enable it via config and see your headless reflection."
"> drives 100mph downtown

> misses a turn

> blames gps

bruh"
"Agreed entirely. I play all genres. I love Mass Effect and I love Civilization. I believe Witcher 3 is one of the best games ever made but I also have over 500 hours of Skyrim. I never compare any of these games. Each is their own beast, even those of the same genre.

But when I’m sold an RPG, that’s what I expect to play. If I’m sold an open game of endless possibilities, that’s what I set my expectations for. No amount of indulgence and good will can sugarcoat their bullshit, regardless if the game they made is good or if it isn’t.

It’s good, flaws and all, but no one can honestly say it’s the game they had been selling for years."
"Yes, it looks like that, if you look at your shadow you look like a mutant."
I’m curious as to why you expected a criminal life simulator?
"> CIG at some point just realized they promised behemoth and they know it can't be done with amount of people and money they have. So... they just f**k around as long as there is some money left and as long as they get more.

I rest my case."
"When you go to meet a character for a main mission, there will be a pop up that states this is the point of no return. And let’s you turn away if you want to return later. No way of missing the notice."
"My one point of critique is that you added in way too much cyan. I genuinely couldnt figure out how her left arm was bending in such a weird way, until I realized its the arm of the girl leaning on her. Purple hair's forearms just bleed into the background."

You mean we shouldn’t expect this to be a exact copy of life in 2077? That this is just a game? Impossible.
Sick! Thx dude.
I had the same issue as you but I found that a super comfortable gaming chair helps with Pc gaming at the desk
"I'm gonna keep my copy. I didn't really get into much of the pre-release hype, so I had no idea what to expect, just that I was expecting a fun experience. 

Yeah, it's not amazing like RDR2, but I'm having fun just waltzing around blasting people. 

Totally understand why people are upset, but that's for giving us this option. I'm personally just gonna keep having fun whacking random people with a katana."
Every. Body.
"Yes, thank you. I have never played an RPG before but this is the most excited I've been in my life for a game. Just the trailers have more depth than any game I've ever played. I think I'll probably enjoy the game at release, no matter what it ends up being."
"When the only fully playable version of the game is on PC and Stadia, no shit console bugs/crashes represent a fraction of the game's issues.

People on PS4 and Xbox One can't play the game in the first place in order for their issues to be counted towards the total number of issues.

Get off your high horse and quit those mental gymnastics lmao"
Not if you have a smartphone (I bet you all do)
"okay lets ask the real question here, what are you playing on and if pc what are the specs."
Got a link to the key caps? Are they double shot?
What quality are you on? My game looks great with medium/high settings.
Literally unplayable!
"Before it was revealed what the DLC was, people hyped it to high heaven as if they were gonna do sixteen free DLCs on the scale of something like a paid DLC from competing RPGs. Much in the same way people have hyped the shit out of Cyberpunk thinking the game is going to be like Second Life or something and you'll be able to do anything your mind can think up. I think most rational people understood it would be small, but that didn't dissuade idiots from acting like CDPR had just turned the entire video game monetization model on its head. 

CDPR didn't really do much to dissuade people from trumpeting the whole ""16 free DLC"" thing and honestly, if it was any other company people would call it out. Like, lots of games add content via patches post-launch, calling it ""free DLC"" is technically correct, but not how it's usually referred to. As an example, Assassin's Creed Odyssey added a whole transmog system post-launch, they didn't advertise it as ""an awesome piece of free DLC"" it was just something that popped up in a patch.

Basically, CDPR calls horse-armor level stuff ""DLC"" and then paid content that adds hours of additional gameplay ""expansions"" but most other companies just add the minor stuff via patches with little to no fanfare and then call their big stuff ""DLC."" If you don't know that about CDPR, ""16 free DLC"" sounds way better than it is."
"Much appreciated. I have a bottle of Proper 12, and a bottle of Four Roses Small Batch that I'll be opening next weekend, to celebrate the game, my friends no longer with us, as well as for everyone else unable to be with us during this time!"
"Cyberpunk isn’t even that bad. Y’all just need to wait for them to refine it, it’s a typical thing all game publishers do. They dial the game back so people complain about what needs fixed then they fix it. Chill it’s not that serious"

From what ive read the junk perk doesnt destroy it
It sucks and isnt fun to read peoples whining over a videogame for every post. I would rather look at memes.
Like 1% deus ex
That's what they want you to think. They would rather have you  blame someone else besides them for how short the game is. I just don't see the reason since around 27% of people who played the Witcher 3 on steam beat the main story. Call of Duty WW2 is only 45% on steam and that is like a 6 hour campaign. I doubt the main reason cyberpunk is shorter is due to the complaints it was probably made shorter just to save some money. I wouldn't mind if the game was the same length it is now if it had the branching storyline the devs hyped about.
Did that mission last night and it was hilarious xD

"I wound up with her, did all her missions besides getting revenge on her ex.

Also make sure you flirt with her any chance you get, and side with her during her arguments with others."
"Lmao, YouTubers just milking audience with clickbait shit videos with EVERY game release, hatewaggon videos giving you tons of views, are you stupid or what, they'd suck a dick for views. Same with karma whoring during first weeks of the release. Let's get real here, from 13+ mil sold copies, reddit sub is under a million, and half of that mil was here long time before the release."
I wish you were speaking from authority. Because if that's literally the only difference between the base PS4 vs PS5 then I would be sooooo relieved.
"Got it in the end, fucking hell"
I would be shocked if they didn’t add transmog some time in the future.
Exactly!
Witcher 3 was trash on release... and I highly doubt it will be optimized as well as Witcher 3 after years of patches

"It's a question no one here can truly answer, only speculate on.  You'd need to know the internals of the company to have an idea.

If I had to guess though, it's likely due to this being their first foray into the genre.  Prior to this, they had done the Witcher, Witcher 2, Witcher 3, Thronebreaker (which is basically Gwent), and Gwent.

In an open world, city game like this there are a lot of complex systems interacting with each other.  Where as other games started relatively simple and built up from there, likely using what they've learned from previous games (GTA, Watch Dogs) CDPR was starting basically from scratch.

That said, there are a few headscratchers that are inexplicably missing.  Things like traffic AI, the police/wanted system, and lack of re-customization.  These are obviously lacking and it makes me thing these systems exist but were 'too buggy' for release.  So band-aids or outright omitting them were the solution instead of releasing them.

I was watching traffic one day around one of the Delamain cars that was going berserk (Beep, Beep, Motherfucker) and traffic was reacting differently.  As in, trying to backup, pull away, change directions.  I don't know why it doesn't do this outside of this scenario.  It just seems to sit there.

I'm hopeful CDPR can make this into a truly great game.  Right now though, it's definitely lacking in some critical areas."
"You're almost certainly going to either be banned or refused classification for child killing in the UK, Germany, or Australia.  Possibly China as well."
"The game is basically linear in its layout.  Side quests and other activities are set dressing, and the decisions are based only at the very end.  

In reality it is generally linear in scale.  If you drew out a map of your decision points it would look like a line.

Compare this to New Vegas where there are like 6 massively different decision points in the first mission, and every mission and side quest from there is pretty drastically different.  New Vegas is like a shrub if you map all the branches.  The ending is decided on a ton of side quests you had multiple ways to approach or could have decided not to do.  And basically up until the very last second, you can change your ending immensely.

Yes, I get that this isn’t Mario, as far as how linear it is, but given the genre of games CP 2077 is in, it is considerably linear."
Tossed my hat in the ring. Why not.
"Maybe the DLC will be ""here we fixed all the fucking bugs that are keeping you from completing main quest missions."""
When are they patching them?
"All of you going on about having played gta as a child so kids playing cyberpunk 2077 today is okay need to seriously take a step back and understand that **the human brain does not finish developing until around the age of 25**. Children, even young adults, are extremely impressionable and don't just automatically have honed critical thinking skills and emotional maturity. 

You played gta when you were a kid? You parents probably dropped the ball then. Did you sit down and have a discussion about the subject matter of the 18+ video game you played as a minor? Did your parents try to provide context for the dark themes you were exploring at such a young age, or did you sneakily play the game with hopes your parents wouldn't find out? Context is important, and without it, children can take the wrong things away from content they can't fully grasp.

At the end of the day, it is the parent's decision to allow their children to be exposed to mature content like intense violence, sexual themes, and existentialism, but under no circumstances is it ""okay"" for kids to play this game just because you got away with playing gta in 2004 (and if this is something you are bragging about/using as an argument, you aren't as fine as you think you are). This game isn't just violent, it touches on some extremely heavy themes and exposing your children to such subject matter (likely without supervision) is going to have consequences, whether you want to admit it or not.

Now, although psychological research has shown that when prosocial elements (team work, perspectivism, etc) are present in games which also have anti social elements (violence, mature language, etc), the prosocial elements negate and supersede the antisocial - the point is moot though, so long as context is not provided to the individual consuming the content. That is to say, if you take COD as an example: you could argue the team element (prosocial) negates the anti social elements (gun violence), however, if a child plays COD devoid of any context, they will *only* take away the anti social elements (e.g. ""violence is fun and I am rewarding for engaging in it""). **Context is key** - make responsible decisions that are appropriate for your child.

EDIT: Read some more comments - seriously, children should not be playing Cyberpunk 2077."
Big and sturdy so I can join the night city baseball team when I’m done with the criminal life.
Maybe V died during the heist and we are all in hell and that’s why the game just kinda sucks
Brother that is haram

Most of this game to me is Photo Mode. All the other stuff is just the in between and a way to afford more clothes.

"7-8 years, and 'bout 10 days to go... I feel your pain.

I'd try to play a game that you'd least expect to play, something that gathers dust on your shelf, if you have games you play to pass the time while you wait for other games, DON'T play those, play the games that you haven't touched in forever.

Me, I've been playing games that I never thought I'd play again to pass the time.

I just booted up Far Cry 5 of all games and I've been having a blast.

And if I aint playing games I'm re-watching a bunch of Let's Play series, specifically Sky Factory atm.

Or if I need a fix of CybERPuNK, I re-watch Blade Runner, still one of my favourite films.

Or Star Wars has always been a part of my life, good times, and oh mah gawd the memes.

Can never go wrong with Terminator either.

Tis but a distraction, for the real prize is December 10th.

Stay strong Samurai, this City **will** burn... Soon."
"Basically all of the hacking system was cut out, see the 48 minute gameplay trailer. Breaching a network isn't done by knocking out a netrunner, plugging into their skull and ""diving"" into the full network. It's just menu options from a distance, one of which can trigger a small minigame."

"It’s major for sure, ammo, meds, mods, grenades, armor, and of course iconics. Pro tip: Make sure you’re lv 50 before you bring any iconic to legendary though because it will be locked at whatever level you are when you craft it and you cannot re-craft it. There are a few you can recraft, those being the ones you can craft from scratch (i.e. sovereign or comrade’s hammer) but ones you need a “base” for like Crash you cannot recraft because you will no longer have an epic version. Also, save before crafting because the rolls can be different and have less damage. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk."
You need to vacuum the carpet

??? What does your comment mean? Those aren’t mutually exclusive things.
"> if 10 years old games did a better job,

Nobody has ever really made a game of this scale and fidelity before.  

You can always pick out games that do 'x' or 'y' better, but you'll usually be pointing to games with different priorities that also have plenty of other things they dont do so well(or aren't doing at all).  

Context is important with comparisons.  CDPR have fell short in a lot of areas no doubt, but this sort of thing is almost inevitable when you're trying to do so much as they tried for here.  It's basically impossible to aim this high and wide and nail everything.  Internal priorities alone will make sure of that, but the more complexity and ambition they added, the more the challenge increases in magnitude, especially having to make everything work together as one package."
Feeling for you. Get well soon
"to be perfectly fucking honest... Keanu Reeves himself hyped it last summer.

Good luck living that up with a buggy release xD"
Oh come on. Dont you know Cyberpunk was massively influenced by the 80s? One earring became a thing then (albeit always a plain gold one). Although I will admit he plays a bit much into his Native American background in his attire.
They didn't spend 8 years on this game. Dev didn't start until after witcher 3.
"""Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer""."
"I thought it was 'A' point of no return, not 'THE' point of no return. Some games have critical story moments that lock you into a mission for maybe a few hours that give you a waring before you start. I thought it would be something like that :("
"Yeah, just seems like pessimism... especially given what's even the big deal with V dies. It's just a character in a videogame. What you should be getting out of it has literally nothing to do with whether V lives or dies unless there is a statement to be made by that. 

And given where we are in the story, the narrative is over it's just a matter of leaving it open for future stories."
"I won't be with this patch though, console is still broken, the graphics have drastically improved (amazing what adding a little reflection can do). However now there frame drops everywhere and the crashes at least on PlayStation are just as common as they ever where.

Considering the amount of console owners... yeah, its not getting positive anytime soon."

">is there a discord or something where these types of additions/changes can be voted on by the community? I feel like that kind of system is the most helpful for devs to watch and prioritize these types of requests

I don't understand why devs don't use the mod community as a barometer for what people want.  They already *added* nudity, which is one of the most requested features, but seriously mod communities create brilliant UI fixes and other quality of life mods, for free, that typically work excellent, and I have never understood why developers don't just use that information. 

There's already a car handling mod for Cyberpunk 2077 - so in a matter of days someone, working for no money, fixed that issue.  

If a Product Manager at a video game company just spent significant amounts of time reviewing the most popular mods for similar games, and for this game, they'd very quickly have not only an excellent list of *what* people want, but also *how* to actually implement it, and what bugs users already report from it."
That's actually part of the lore. Guns have become so common that it's not illegal or dangerous to be open carrying them in public.

Rather sad to say.

"Dude, reviewers hardly every finish a game. They may say they do, but they don't.  Reviews don't mean shit anymore. To truly review any sort of Game, Music, Movie or TV Show a person would need to stew on it for days, weeks or in some cases months to make an actual informed and reflective opinion.  Now a reviewer will review an entire TV series based on 2 episodes from season 1.    Game reviewers now-a-days major in English and journalism and then take the gaming part on secondary.  They're all shit tier newbs."
"IV's police was a massive improvement over the 3D era GTA games (III, Vice City, San Andreas, and other spin offs).  In SA, I could cheese the police to maximum stars by standing on the second floor of a parking garage and chucking grenades out onto the ground at them.  Even though there was an open ramp up the garage, the AI didn't know to go up it (unless they were on my tail and I led them up it).  

When I first played IV, it blew my mind seeing the police climb up ladders to the rooftop of buildings or using the stairwell to get there, this was something the cops in 3D era GTA games didn't think to do.  As such, I find it is extremely difficult in the HD era GTA games (IV and V) to hole up at a location and just pick them off with ranged weapons, the AI knows how to access you now."

At least as femV who romanced Judy, she leaves you a message and you can hear V in the background saying it's time for breakfast.

You can hide the truth to both Panam and Judy so they don't know you're going to die in +-6 months. Any ending was a bummer for me... Like everything is fruitless. I know that was their intention but couple it with the disappointment from the game and it left me pretty empty.!<"

"I was being facetious of course. It's more 7/10 at the moment. Parts they did finish are great though. Also cyberpunk in this game isn't that dystopian compared to others. But still pretty bleak with the socioeconomic focus in this game. Cyberpunk genre inherently is dystopian though

With patches and dlcs I can see this hitting 9 easily. Once the edgelords tire over repeating the same complaints and memes again and again and actually finish the game, I hope we can move on from this. If cdpr want to save their company there's no way they're abandoning this game without enhancing it, so I don't see what everyone is worried about. It's literally just been the first week and they act like day 1 edition is the final edition"

"It's not THAT much better on the PC. The graphics are amazing, definitely, but there are still so many graphical bugs everywhere, just when I start to get into the game and almost feel immersed another one pops up. I'm used to playing games with funny graphical bugs that pop up every once in a while and they normally don't bother me, but in this game it's constant. There's no escaping them. I can't even watch a cutscene of Jackie eating food because he has 4 chopsticks in his hand and another pair is floating in the air. It's kinda hard to get into the story with that kind of shit going on.

The game runs fine and isn't crashing, the city is really beautiful, but I'm struggling to enjoy it and appreciate it. Even on the PC I played for an hour this morning and could easily make a montage video that's twice as long as this with all the bugs I ran into."
Pretty sure its only specific bds that will play.
"Yes, that's true but CDPR never never do such ""sandbox"" games like gta. Their mistake is that they promoted it like it is. For my opinion they just don't have enough experience in such way. Instead they doing great story telling, not only main, side missions but also there is over hundred hidden gems with their little story."

"Oh, yeah. F4 romances, lol. And how deep they are, exactly? You just carry your companion behind, boost their opinion about you by lockpicking trashcans, than get 2 lines and a charisma check - bam, you re in a relationship. 

Yes, Cyberpunk have only 4 options in total, 2/2 for male/female. 1/1/1/1 per orientation. But this is compensated by incomparable level of writing, that actually make you believe that you're growing closer with a character. With Judy you're sharing her trauma and deep suffering, giving her a shoulder. With Panam you're just playing daredevils, going all flirty and supportive to break her insecurity. Dunno about River and Kerry, skipped them on my 1st playthrough. 

So yeah, its basically quality > quantity."
Man I’m just hoping they can add all the cut features in free DLC like the witcher 3
I’m still stuck on my first main mission with Panam. Every time I get in the car with her it endlessly loads. Maybe they’ll fix that so I can play the story again lol it has been shelved for the time being

Yeah I think there is a tradeoff between good storytelling and choice branching. There has to be forced continuity at some points or else the story won't make sense or will be spread too thin and lack depth.

"I think its funny that CD Project Red said multiple times that we its not a GTA in the future, its RPG first, and the rest second. The RPG elements, story, character development is great, the sidequests (not the gang hideouts, i mean the real sidequests, many people on this sub didnt even played the game till they got to them, like the one with the car personalities) are creative and as good, if not better than the ones from witcher.

They never made a game open world in the modern time, witcher is far less complex than that with just some horses here and there and monsters and soldiers, they never made a game with cars, huge amounts of pedestrians, guns etc. why is it so hard for people to understand that this is new to them and that its not meant to be GTA 2077?"

"Base PS4? If so, you're lucky. My game crashed more than 20 times before I eventually gave up and deleted it. Most of the time it happened while looting or while starting those 'random' crimes. Crashing my car usually resulted in the game crashing too.

I had a little bit of fun, enough to make me want to play it again in the future (Hopefully on a PC or in a PS5), but hated almost everything about playing it on PS4. TBH, the only thing that made me keep playing was the story. Hated everything else."

"Not to be mean, but I think the whole team at the studio would break down if they saw this video. That's because it shows all of the mistakes they have done and how their broken promises brought abit too much hype in order to beg for perfect reviews and increase revenue.

I dont deny the fact that the game has so much potential to build on and we finally got the game after eight years btw. It's just how they executed the product and the events leading up to it."
Street cred is probably one of the most worthless stats I’ve ever seen in a game.  You can get to level 50 after a few quests

"It's a bold move but CDPR needs Sony way more than Sony needs CDPR. Release a janky ass shitty game so bad you need to promise people refunds, when you're not the one who decides who gets refunds, without consulting the person who does, that's some irresponsible little kid behaviour sony doesn't need."
It's going to go back up when it's working anyways so they'll probably just make sure the next patch they release is big enough to fix it. Probably won't be till January anyways as they already said they're going on holiday hiatus.
"Yeah they had a ton of goodwill after TW3, and that is *incredibly* valuable. Look how much free advertising the game got from the hype, even aside from the massive amount of money they put into advertising. This will *not* be the case for their next game. They are going to get virtually no preorders, people will avoid buying it day 1, and then many will just not notice that it came out and forget to pick it up, even if it’s good. This is just an incredibly stupid move to stick to their guns on this one:"
Level 40 street cred after 20 hours? Are you just following the story?
That's the only glitch I've had.  Random death.
"Yeah, I wish I didn't watch it"
Do the reviewers get the day 1 patch? They all seem to mention a plethora of bugs.....
Are you Black? Ok then. So stay out of Black people’s business and stop trying to act as the moral overseer
"The main reasons for the state of the game are as follows:

* The company going public. This is why EA, Activision and the rest of the garbage publishers continue to push Dev studios to release half baked games. Their goal is to maximize profits in shortest time possible. This creates a lot of pressure/tension for the company that takes their funds, and sometimes unrealistic goals. This is why CDPR is in the shitter now. Not only did they take gov funding, but they decided to go public due to their success with Witcher. 
* Bad management. If you think they didnt know what they were releasing, or someone on the inside wasnt aware then you have 0 clue how the software industry works as a whole. The Dev team and QA would NEVER want to release the game in the state it was released. Because then they would all lose their jobs releasing garbage. Both sides communicate with the product teams/stake owners, and the rest of the chain. It was ultimately the upper management who gave the green light, and we know internally the Dev/QA team were very angry with the company even before the public shareholder call. So deduce the rest on your own. 
* Bad Planning. The amount of RPG elements in this game is the same as Call of Duty, not much. I dont understand WHAT they were working on, besides the main story narrative and secondary quests. Seriously, this game has 0 customization options for the weapons outside of mods, and silencers/red dots. This is TERRIBLE, and cannot be called an RPG. There is no customization to the character beyond the initial pickings, clothing cannot be customized. Listen I can go on with the cops, no bike riders being present on the roads, etc etc. I simply cannot believe such a huge studio only finished the main city (cut a shit ton from it), main quest lines and forgot everything else. 

&#x200B;

I am going to throw out a conspiracy theory and say that this game is the poster child for pushing gaming hardware, Nvidia RTX cards specifically. The development team was polishing a turd the whole time to make sure the rays hit the piece of crap just right to satisfy Nvidia $ backing and forgot to actually make cops, and the rest of the features in this game function correctly."

"Conspiracy Theory Mode:
What if they deliberately released the game full of visual bugs, to distract people from what a total mess they made of the story and main quests? 

If the game worked perfectly, driving physics were good, animations were all there, textures all looked nice, AI was good, cops behaved like real cops etc, etc, etc, what we would be left with is a confusing mess of a game with inconsistent theming which doesn't really go anywhere. It doesn't do anything remotely original or even tell an interesting story.

It's much less interesting than any RPG I've played in years, the only interesting part is that you're in the future, and they mess that up by making it a very unrealistic and confusing future."
Sadly they are just paid advertisers who write buy me bait.
It's still pretty fun on a low-middle end PC despite the UI constantly bugging out and the hilarious assortment of other bugs.

"You really think the general public had any say over when the game released? If so, we would have gotten games like Duke Nukem Forever way before it's actual release."
Indeed. How can any fully grown adult sit there and enjoy hearing someone obnoxiously yell over the dialogue of a game to give their shitty 2 cents about something they don't even fully take in or understand themselves?
Whose genius idea was it to compare themselves to a game with 1% of it's playerbase left after months
"I'd have to find a source, but I even recall the head guy also told the staff not to look at the reviews and that it was only him looking down at the negativity. He wanted the staff to focus on fixing the game and not get bogged down by negativity. Everyone can shit on him as much as they want, but it's clear he wanted NMS to be a good game. They're made a lot of changes but it took years (and technically the core gameplay loop hasn't really changed much)"
It's just replacing existing files. Nothing is being added to the game

"PC Player. 
Got a new Ryzen 7 5800X and 3070 with 32GB RAM for this game only. I have a 2560*1080p 29"" monitor from LG. 

Problem 1. FPS drops to 10/12 in daylight. Couldn't play the ripperdoc mission at all. Settings is high. I have changed DLSS settings to no avail. I can play in low settings, but why should I? My system should support this. 

Problem 2. The FPS is better if I play in 1080p. Playing in ultrawide it is behaving like I'm running the game in super ultra resolution that my system can't handle, when I'm actually is in full hd, just in a different ratio. 

Problem 3. More ultrawide issue. If I use full-screen 1920*1080, there is a crop, as it should be, but instead of a black screen like every other game, even plants vs zombie, it is showing my background desktop like it is in windowed mode. If I do full-screen borderless in 1920*1080p, the resolution is stretched to fit my 21:9 monitor, resulting in botched graphics. 

Problem 4: if I play in 2560*1080, in a lot of information scene, the text are cut.  As if the information scene is in 21:9, but is presented as 16:9, so along where the black borders should be the information isn't visible from there.  

I haven't posted pics for possible spoilers. But if required, I'll post screenshots on Imgur and link back. 

What should I do? 

I understand there is a hex edit that'd allow me to use my ryzen processor's multi cores efficiently, but haven't I paid AAA prices to not tinker those myself? And for someone who has been waiting since the mantis blade lady in slo mo teaser dropped even before Witcher 3 came out, I'm a little bit disappointed. 

Sorry my issues are not overall performance issue and mostly centering towards ultrawide monitor support, which I realise not everyone has, but since the game is next gen, ultrawide support should be the norm, I believe."
"They say “you must enjoy the game for what it IS”

But not even a MONTH before release we were being lied to, with Cdpr promising a lot of features that are not in the game.

Just watch the NC wire episodes"
Yeah thats just not at all true
Also didn't they say you needed an implant to translate text that wasn't in your native language? That shit would be so cool
"The most chartable assumption I can make is that it relates to the game's optimization issues. They couldn't figure out all their optimization issues, especially on console. AI eats up power. It seems like AI was throttled back overall, and it's not quite as simple to adjust AI quality based on system power as it is with graphics.

The game would have issues regardless, but I feel like a lot of the problems stem from trying to make it work on last gen consoles."

"See what happened with the /r/thelastofus2 subreddit? It's been a wakeup call for gaming subreddit moderators. Pointless to explain at this moment because we could debate on and on; but as one of the former content moderators, I know that despite opposing the decision personally, there must have been a lot of thought and consideration put into this choice.

We'll see how this gambit pays off. Also from what I can tell from knowledge as my time as a subreddit moderator, CDPR community representatives don't particularly like the subreddit mods."
"I don't think games necessarily have to have it, but it is becoming more common in open world/RPG games. A lot of the bigger games in that genre that I can think of (GTAV, RDR2, Skyrim, Fallout 4, Saints Row) have this feature, so it's just kind of weird that this one -which as I'm sure you've heard a hundred times now on this sub, was touted as being ""next level""- left it out."
Lowkey racist but ok
"> I know D1 patch will fix many of these issues

PCGamer said it was buggy as hell even with the patch, and ended their review with ""Play it in a few months""."
CDPRats ... it wasn’t your fault. You never had a voice to reach out and tell us how unfinished the game was...

Yup

it's not even too far off from the truth.. 27fps here.. ;-(
"This actually got me cracking up out loud.. on my own. Thank you for the laugh, this is way too true."
"I completely agree. I was hyping myself up to get a 3080 once they came back in stock thinking a 2070S wouldn't manage 1440p with high fps, but this certainly changes things. Might hold off on upgrading until the game officially comes out to see the differences now that the specs are out."
"I play on PC bro, I’m def not playing on downgraded hardware, check my build (5900X, 3090), I’m completely maxed out in settings dude.

The running animations just aren’t finished, and it’s clear as day. The motion matching from walk to run (and even running) looks completely unfinished.

The Witcher 3 had better running animations by FAR."

And while Rainbow Cadenza is a reference to a book, a Cadenza is also a solo work inserted into the end of a symphony.

I played around with that too and it still wasn't enough.
It’s a shame how empty it is especially when they could have added genuine parkour to the game. Traversing and climbing to places you aren’t supposed to reach is one of my favourite things to do. I find myself constantly wondering if they playtested this game or if they thought they were just making the right decisions all along.
"To everyone saying it’s a “next gen game”. Most people are still on current gen hardware, it’s not a next gen game, it just isn’t, it was announced before the PS4 was even released, they definitively did not make it with “next gen in mind”. The original release date for this game was slated for before the next gen consoles where even announced. If you charge people $50 for a game on their system of choice, it better run on that system, simple as"
Rightfully so!
The most jarring part is switching back to first person as you fly over the handlebars and hit the pavement. And I usually get hit by a car or two on my way back to my bike.
"GoT in my opinion represents the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of optimisation. 

Take into account that it was made by Sony Developers, for their system, and of course what people will say about its lack of population density and much smaller rendering etc. compared to Night City. 

But it really is a quality game. The textures, frames, load times, voice acting, and one thing I really noticed was how well used the controller configuration was.

GoT will humbly go down as one of my favourite games of the past generation- HZD also falls into this category for many of the same reasons."
"They don't, but they said they'd release better modding tools for TW3 and then never did."
"To be fair, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that is worth it's 60 USD, but no more. I definitely got good hours out of it.

Out of all the bugs, issues, and amateur design choices (like no crafting in bulk? no transmog layer?), the biggest one has to do with it's core: the story. It's not fitting of a game like this, but it's not bad either (well written characters, albeit pretty short lived, helped greatly). Besides doing another playthrough to see a different build or path, the story really leaves me feeling like there's nothing more to it and nothing more to come back to. I beat the game on Very Hard and saw all endings + did the solo path: a DLC wouldn't get me to come back for sure.

If the story was even nearly as great as the Witcher 3, RDR2, GoW, etc, people wouldn't be as disappointed as they are now.

This tells me it's not even a matter of pushing too soon, but rather they made poor choices to begin with and would have ended up like this no matter what but with less bugs."
I'll end up playing a few times to see the outcomes ... already on my 2nd valhalla playthrough. Sucks that the female voice actor is terrible tho
I really wish Rockstar had the Cyberpunk license.

"The way it's set up is that when the body is ""disposed"" of, Like say in a van, freezer or cabinet, Then for all intents and purposes they stop existing in the game world, Think death trigger.

This might be because there are few assassination missions where you ""kill"" them by putting them into the fixers cars without having to deal with the moral implications, Think of the car as a similar container, Once the body is in the car, They are no longer part of the game world.

Also if you carry a body and ""drop"" them, There is a chance the head will explode like an overripe tomato, So to avoid this happening, Stand before dropping the body, This may be due to a nasty collision issue."

The game was delayed for nearly a year to fix the bugs. Any major bugs will be unacceptable. All I’ve seen on this sub over the year is how they’re not like other companies releasing a game with bugs and waiting to get it right. It’s funny how that tone changed and now the CDPR simps are ok with them releasing a game with bugs all of a sudden.
You cant expect to reload on last gen bro ^/s

"Why not? That's literally one of the closest comparisons to this game. It's literally open world deus ex. Have you played any of those games? 

Engaging: deep cyber augmentation, perks, and hacking that allows you to build the man-machine you want that directly affects how you approach problems. Living breathing world with shops, bars, clubs, districts, different gangs with different themes, side quests that impact each other based on your choices. There's so many it's hard to name just one. Have you played this game?"
If only they put Kojima on the design team.
There’s a rumour that Keanu wanted a bigger role in the game so they cut content out of the game and formed the story around Keanu.

"The real treasure were the memes we made along the way. 

But for real, I think the memes for this game have made me laugh the hardest this year."
"I personaly enjoyed the game, but there is an insane amount of bugs in the game. It is to the extent where I at a certain point started appreciating how well Rockstar Games have made RDR2 and GTA V.

In the 40 hours I played I found myself frequently having to restart the game because the camera bugs out, npc voices get muted or my character's forward movement gets bugged. At one point I ended up banging a dude because I thought I was talking to the chick in front of me, but turned out I was actually talking to the Joytoy dude standing a good distance behind her. Besides that there are so many other gameplay bugs like certain mods not stacking together, clunky movements, cars disappearing, enemies running at superspeed etc."
"The dude doesn’t answer any questions about how undeveloped the game is...like I get patching is good and all.

But CDPR, you made a metric shit load of promises and didn’t even add them to the game. Even if it shipped in perfect working condition, cyberpunk is 1/2 the game we were shown and promised.

That’s a much bigger issue than the bugs that can be fixed. Very high levels of false advertising here. Someone is going to sue their pants off."

Of course they are awesome! (Who doesn't?!)

Do man have to behave like horny chimps who have been stranded on no-fap island and see T/A for the first time in years and now need them in every aspect of their lives?

No that's a pretty much a choice.

Fun fact:
For most of modern Human history women had been considered wild sex crazy beasts who would hump anyone/thing they can get their hands on and had therefore to be contained and restricted.

Who knows if that's true or just a Patriarchal wet dream to justify the power difference but it's certainly fun to think about there maybe was a complete role change to the modern gender roles.

Imagine a group of young and innocent male aristocrats walking across the street only to be cat called by a group of female street weavers, running home and complaining how this toxic women culture is out of control."
"This is proof you spent time developing a DLC instead of selling a finished game. What was the plan, sell it after 6 months from initial release?"
One of the major things that allowed me to enjoy the Witcher 3 was the mod that auto-looted everything around me. The game was 100x more enjoyable after that. I hope we get that soon for CP2077

"I love the anesthetics of all of the designs in this game. From Furniture to Guns to Cars. They look like how you'd expect them to look in 2077. And they aren't cheesy designs that look like they're from 80s future movies, or overly futuristic like a lot of modern science fiction movies. Big Props to the devs and artists at CDPR"
Grain in cinematic games kinda works. I don't mind it on Spiderman: Miles Morales.
They should not forget to add gwent to the game. Its a must feature lol

"Because the game is weird and broken, the exact same shit happened to me without any types of edits. I was getting low 50s fps in one area that was quick saved, reopened the game and was getting high 60s fps. It could be memory leak of sorts causing it, it could be anything. But it sure as shit is not this file because the game does not access it to even read the data from it. The lines are even commented out ffs and OP as a C# programmer apparently should understand that means even if the file was accessed the data wouldn't be read. It's a comment meant not to be read by the application."

"Got lucky during the Best Buy drop thankfully! I was so happy when I did, because I had this build in mind the moment I saw the card. I just love the design of the cooler. It really screams Arasaka and next gen"
And majority of grpaphics in RDR2 is empty field with low npc and the same assets around. Its totally different setup and different tricks used to make it work. Those don't work on world like CP city.

Oh definitely! I just wasn't sure about labeling either of those as cyberpunk but I guess they actually are. Dredd is a masterpiece.
Those are low numbers. If you put the mod on the gun then you can get crits and the damage will be in the hundreads of thousands. Add on top of that all the insane buffs you can get for pistol from levels and clothing.
I do!  I actually never played any of them past the 2nd.  But I distinctly remember the DOS games
exactly the same happened to me lol
The soundtrack was wack

best car in the game IMO because the traction is through the roof to make it work offroad but that translate to it cornering amazingly on sealed doesnt make sense but pretty good car anyway
"Yeah I agree, those poor developers. Management screwed some talented people"
"Actually i think it's a different reason. For some reason, Vs gender seems tied to their body not their voice. So you can have male body and female voice (which means female pronouns and similar) and still romance panam. I think..."
Bruh me too I thought I had accidentally picked a vagina or some shit
"So far it's sounding just like my Strandberg headless guitar or my LTD Alexi Laiho guitar. Honestly I'm just glad I made it work, haha."
"This game has the problems of fans seeing something most games won't let you do and then bitching because it's not a fully fleshed out feature.
 If this was any other game they'd have slapped an invisible wall so you couldn't get up there.

I'd rather be allowed to go up there than be told what level of quality I should be restrained to....if I wanna get up there I should be allowed to whether they could possibly perfectly finish the city...I don't care. Just becomes a new feature with it's own challenges."
You're in over your head
I'm sorry you guys are gonna have to see leaks.  Thank you for making sure the rest of us can go spoiler-free.
"There's one at an assault in progress on top of a hotel, I think in Pacifica too"
"Also: for crafting skill progression rewards 7 and 12, what does ""increases chance to acquire component from crafting by 5% mean?"" I don't get that."
"I wanted my character to have a severe sexual addiction, but I cant. Only 2 ppl to bang?! That's not sexual addiction, thats a relationship."
"My best friends call me for a good time but for an eddie, I'll call you daddy."
"I've played it for 4 hours non stop. I found it kinda disappointing to be honest. So many visual bugs, screen flickering, blurry feeling overall, SHIT OPTIMIZATION, empty npcs(I mean, we have rdr2 and this is just so much worse)
But the story is cool, even if the corpo beginning is basically just a big cutscene. Also the controller settings on pc are so bad, why the fuck is the acceleration so big???? And why isn't shooting aim separated from viewing aim?
The one thing I love the most in this game: my boi jack. That guy is funny as hell."
"Ya im totally bored with it. Completed 2 playthroughs. Because of the horrible backlash I'm sure this company wants to move on from this game. Best thing about a game is its replay ability or multi-player which this game has none.
Had people not set out to destroy CDPR we probably would have got some good DLC. NOW IM SCRATCHING MY HEAD WHAT SHOULD I PLAY? I do not want to go back to ESO just yet lol. They did release another DLC tho so I might have to."

Well there is a large crossover between gamers and Qanon conspiracy loons
None of the hair colors on PC look like this in the menu... How do you get the white hair?
"I think it in part to the marketing as well. If this game was a unheard of indie game that came out of nowhere and ran exactly the way it did now, I'd be able to forgive the jank. But for what was being sold for yeaaaarrrrrrssssssss, it's unforgivable for me.

I keep comparing it to Deadly Premonition. If you haven't heard of this game, It's essentially a B-movie version of Resident Evil 4 mixed with a semi-open world inspired by Twin Peaks. That game is janky and glitchy, but I love it and forgive so much about it because of the fact it's a weird indie game from japan obviously made by a guy who loved Twin Peaks.

BUT, if this game was hyped up for years as being THE NEXT LEVEL IN SURVIVAL HORROR, RESIDENT EVIL....PLEASE HAND OVER YOUR CROWN... and the existing game is what I ended up playing. I'd be pissed and would never have finished it.

Cyberpunk feels like a indie game pretending to be big budget gaming tentpole and I wish I hadn't listened to all the developer fed communication leading up because it set everyone up for what essentially sounded like Red Dead Redemption 2, but in a futuristic city. What we got was a lesser than Deus Ex awkwardly shoehorned into an open world."
Any way to play it early on ps4? Would a vpn work ?
The teleports are all at bus stops and subway stations
insert rap god joke here
"Keywords here are ""finish it."" They shouldn't release a half finished game. I don't know how the hell this culture of releasing games that are a year+ out from being finished happened but it needs to stop. Pathetic money grabbers"
Would be awesome! Please link me a pic if you do! Would love to see it!
"45-60 and solid 60 inside buildings. Custom preset- low to medium, though. The game still looks beautiful and it loads everything right, since I installed it on an NVME"
Rick Ross
"> Graphics and animations are stunning, core gameplay is polished (not talking about netcode and servers here) and single player is a piece of art and will be in the hall of fame for the next decade or longer.

So true, and this is coming from someone who doesn't enjoy the old wild west theme. I had a hard time in the beginning, because it's a VERY slow game. But man... Once it sucks you in... The landscape makes you feel the breeze. It's surreal."
"25 fps? Lol. It drops to like 25 only in Saint Denis. And, that's still 10 FPS higher than CP2077. Lmao."
His name's Chut Chontent
"> trying to **brake** it?

I don't think their job is to stop the game completely."
"That’s interesting. I have done minimal driving, mostly staying on foot or utilizing fast travel. Let me get in my car and go for a long drive."
This PLUS all of the other seemingly harmless bugs EQUALS garbage. Why don't people understand that.
You'd almost say those trailers were an entirely different game
"Delamin won’t speak anymore when I answer his calls, glitched quest, I like Regina’s quests tho."
I already know I'll save and load for the netwatch options though the gameplay videos kind of already told me what will happen.
Sure thats fair. And if they didn't add them then there'd be outrage that there's no streetraces.
Holy shit smiling panam looks beautiful.
That was the moment I realized V was kind of a dick when Johnny had to tell me to stop being a dick lol
If the game was in a better state in November they would have shipped then. What's so hard?
CDPR brings millions and millions of dollars into Poland by selling to countries around the world. It benefits all of Poland for those games to sell well. What do you not get about that?
NGL I wish more places emulate. The world design is top tier...would love to see this use of neon and color irl.
">Everysingle rpg as decisions and such thaf do this. People have been crying that there isnt enough rpg in this game and then people claim this bollocks.  
>  
>Judy is a lesbian, she isnt gonna fuck a man. Get over yourse

What the.....rpg ='s options. Let my dialogue choices give me a chance to win her/this person over.

Or...as  you seem to be advocating....no matter what I say/do this person npc is not changing.

Because CDPR ran out of time. The former seems much more fun imho."
Squating at its finest
Or they hardcoded the barrels to scale with player HP rather than level/enemy level
"Even in Claire's races it was next to useless, at least on base PS4. It only renders like a block in front of you at a time, so I was basically blind beyond that"
"The same could be said if you read the comments on LowSodiumCyberpunk, man."
Just be glad a family member didn't walk in on you.
*cries in ps4*
"right? I feel like it was only a select few, and someone compiled all the videos together and gives the impression that everyone was experiencing this"
"well now we know where the problem with the company lies - this delusional guy right here.


Unfortunately he also happens to be a major player within the company so continue to defend CDPR for their buSiNesS prAcTicE, I'm sure Adam would love to f*** you again in their next release."
"There is some kind of blending of main story and side quests (Rogue's, Panam's and Judy's, especially those first two). Also the fact that in the beginning you really don't know what to do with the relic in your head justifies why there is no rush - you have to get to certain characters, wait for them, then wait for parade, then wait again, etc. There are also few dead ends like with Hellman. I think that they knew about that issue with plot so that's why they implemented that waiting.

I think that hey could fix some issues by rewriting part of the story and put more more emphasis on how V (and Johnny) don't want to get help directly from Arasaka so you could get it right away after that short story or have more story related incentive to search of outside help (from Rogue or Panam). They could even make it that quick ending with Arasaka saves you but with heavy consequences to world but waiting for help leads to some of current endings because it's too late to save you."
Is there anyway to get rid of the quests auto tracking? The big yellow waypoint on my map is very annoying
"No you’re not the only one. There have been plenty of posts agreeing.

EDIT: I didn’t read the whole post whoops. I’m glad you brought it up"
"I'm just going to point out that both GTA V and RDR2 had NPCs with their own unique daily routines and personality, so the reason we believed those ""marketing flufs"" is because we've seen it countless times in games that came out YEARS ago."
SO THEY'RE JUST LETTING PEOPLE PIRATE THE GAME
I'm an older guy. What a lad
"It's entirely possible. Jamie, pull that up"
So can you romance Judy as corpo? Asking for a friend.
🤣🤣🤣
"Except borderlands actually feels like its the best at what it does in this respect, and each class actually feels unique, branches out over tons of different mods, and OF COURSE the game is predicated on youd ability to find GUNS, tons and tons of GUNS, FOR NO FUCKING REASON. Personally, I'm a Borderlands stan for life, because I love the experience of the game since 1. Cyberpunk 2077 fails to even live in Borderlands shadow in terms of a looter shooter that it wants to be soooooo badly."
Wait I can mod to have the sex with Garbage Bag Dress Man?
Not gonna lie. I almost completely forgot about those police. Back when I thought you'd be playing one of those. I wonder what part they'll play in the final game. Considering that they get introduced in the opening they will play *some* part.
Makes no sense. I’m on series x and have been loving all of it besides the waypoint system maybe lol
Yeah especially original Skyrim! Real CTD nest with a couple of heavy mods installed.
"$10 cheaper for physical at Amazon and Walmart.

Otherwise nope unless you want it as a collector or to resell when your ""done""."
"> You're unhinged.

Unhinged? Are you okay? Got problems? You need to talk to someone or why the fuck are you talking embarrassing bullshit, fella? I am just angry at condescending and arrogant people. You just happend to be one of them, buddy."
"No i dont like it.

This is absolutely no good for Combat. No Vest or Pants to Carry Mags, no Holster for CC or OC, no Bulletproof Vest for Protection...

F-"
"For years the big hook of this game was customization this and that. 


Meanwhile the worst WWE 2K game puts it to shame."
"I don’t know where you live so it definitely varies. In south west U.S. every store is open, just wear your mask, you’ll be okay

also best buy will price match"
"I honestly feel like this is a problem because they had and idea and set it up for it and then shit the bucket. I found a really good iconic SMG (I want to craft a better one but the crafting in this game isn’t balanced at all either which frustrates me to absolutely no end.) and it has a mid slot. I slotted know centrmass and that gun is a complete laser. The issue is most guns don’t have mod options and such. This would be better if they gave less loot, made components more useful and made mods/attachments better. I honestly expected to be able to tear guns apart or a much smaller version of the COD MW gunsmith. But instead I have a few mod slots on a few guns that have small changes and the possibility to craft some weapons that takes forever because the component balance is none existing."
"I am never getting hyped for another cdpr game ever again. Looks bad,is boring,ui sucks,audio sucks,glitchs everywhere,bullet sponge enemies,driving fells off. Cant wait for the true kings of open world games to release gta 6. 8 years for this,hell....Hades the indie game is 100 times better than this shit."
The review copies do use Denuvo DRM which is known to impact performance. I am pretty sure the release copy does not use Denuvo.
Looks like you’re pulling an all nighter
The game is broken thats the state of the game
"who cares about pointless garbage , cut content and missing features, that's probably what they are giving as free dlc ."
I’m just elated my guess about the Always Sunny reference was on point lol
Used in a characters quest.
I don’t think there’s gonna be content drops for a few months at least. Just enjoy
"It's not entirely random I think, it seems to be a mix of level and what it is, a t-shirt and a bullet proof vest looted off the same level enemy the vest will be better, the difference strides when the t-shirt was from a much high level enemy"
"To be fair I have a fucking knife that does 2500+DPS, headshot crits do way more.  


And my Comrade's hammer is 100% crit chance."
"They'll die on that hill because their marketing team and investors keep them up there with picthforks. Same happened with Fallout 76 and Todd Howard. No matter how terrible your product is, you have to come out and act all delusional as if it's really not that bad."
Damn
Why can I never find those boots
"Same man, I just want to experience the game and as long as its playable I dont mind the rest of it all aha"
"SPOILERS

 No shit...  I finished the main storyline and now I don’t want to bother playing  the game anymore. THIS ending is the great hyped “become a night city legend” they advertised and that I worked through to get: a  demeaning and sad end? JHC..."
Way to downplay the horrendous and laughable state the game is in.
"Ok, that kind of response from CDPR is a bad omen, and above all pathetic, i think being defensive, even knowing you screwed up, is very regrettable."
"Wait public opinion has shifted, where do you see that. Not trying to sound like a dick. I’m curious actually"
"I only realized it by chance, kept getting Overheated by some un-seen Netrunner. I was just fucking around and closed the laptop in the room I was in and it stopped. 

Learned that the laptops have cameras and that enemy netrunners could hack them to hack you. 

This game still impresses me :D"
"Okay, you're valid."
"It really doesn't, because your ""opinions"" are straight up denial of facts.

Keep at it."
I actually never fast traveled in 50 hours. But yeah. You don't need to buy a car.
"I think the overmarketing might have had something to do with the insane expectations for this game. They talked too much and too soon. I ignored most of it and expected an open world Immersive Sim/Deus Ex style game with Witcher style writing, and I got exactly that.

> The game itself is hardly revolutionary

I might disagree here a little. They managed to build the most fleshed out, densest urban environments I think I've ever seen in Night City. Its such a well crafted city. The mature writing and characters were spot on for me. Plus pulling off basically an open world scale version of Deus Ex is no small feat. After the dust settles, I see people realizing what this game really brings."
"I know it was already clarified, but if somebody is throwing a Portal themed birthday party, I don't think you can automatically assume that there will actually be any cake."
"The performance should be *similar* but the PS5 will likely have faster load screens and the XSX should have more stable frame rate. XSX is very powerful and fast. PS5 is very fast and powerful. 

At the end of the day the difference *should* be negligible. Buy the console you want.

_____

To be clear I expect PS5 to have stable frames and XSX to have fast load screens as well."
I want to want to buy and play this game so bad but damn CDPR...
"> so she probably didn’t say the truth so I wouldn’t just jam out and sing along loudly to it all the time to tease and annoy her

Well, congratulations, now you can!"

"What character be build did you have? That's exactly what I'm doing now.. I'm working on a Intelligence, Technical - haven't picked the third to level up yet."
Whole game is.
"Ahhh yeah fair enough, in my head I always separate the two but yeah it is the same thing. I always spend ages picking skill points and stuff in RPGs, and always have to google 'is there a respec in x', as I always worry about regretting it later."
Nerd.
"If you love granular character customization, check out Black Desert Online and other Korean/Japanese made games. Insane levels of customization."
But there's no duck face.
Nice....learning photograph on the side myself...experimenting with photo mode and what not
"Nice find if they truly have made this mistake.

Sort of inexcusable at some point for CDPR, considering they're charging a good amount of money for a game that has so many issues still."
"The game doesn't tell you, but if you hold the crouch button or press it (depends on the dialogue skip setting you have set) it will allow you to stand/crouch without skipping dialogue. Found that out after way to much skipped dialogue."
